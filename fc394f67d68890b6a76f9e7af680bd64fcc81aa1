It doesn\u0027t follow Dbus conventions for enums.\n\nDoesn\u0027t use the generated redfish enums: https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/5db33d60ca6c3be2b799f5fd0fd311c37917fd70/redfish-core/include/generated/enums/pcie_device.hpp#L17\n\nAnd clearly wasn\u0027t tested.  Lets remove it in one patch, and we can re-add when someone is willing to follow the conventions.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/88902e67bcd86b2122b4c1f3b1eaa550b329b08a/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Inventory/Item/PCIeDevice.interface.yaml#L7\n\nAlso shows that this is a string value, while in Redfish it\u0027s an enum value.  That means that these two parameters can\u0027t mix.",
