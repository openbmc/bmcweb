Otherwise how do I even work?\n\nNo disagreement there, but Google hardware has its own quirks.  In this role, you\u0027re not a maintainer for google, you\u0027re a maintainer for all of openbmc, so you need to consider more hardware than just Googles.\n\n\u003e That\u0027s how I tested all the commits I did in the project and some commits that I reviewed. You reviewed most of the patches and should have seen I said tested on hardware in the commit message.\n\nYep, and basically all of those I tested on real upstream hardware to verify that it worked, because I\u0027m the maintainer and that\u0027s part of the responsibility.  If you\u0027re becoming a maintainer with this commit, that responsibility will transition in part to you for the things you maintain.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I don\u0027t have a public hardware. I believe most of Google contributors don\u0027t have a public hardware.\n\u003e \n\u003e What I was saying is that, for the parts that I maintained, testing on Google hardware is sufficient. Is that fair?\n\nConsidering that google has patches against many subsystems, no, generally testing only on downstream systems isn\u0027t sufficient to verify that they meet the published dbus interfaces.  Many times we have patches that are only tested on downstream clients, and cause bugs in upstream because of it;  It\u0027s a maintainers job to use judgement on how much to accept.",
