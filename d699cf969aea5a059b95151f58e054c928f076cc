I think I misinterpreted your statement. \n\"MOVE your code in one commit, then make your functional change in another.\"\n\nIs the correct way to split this commit for easier reviewing to:\nPart 1) In first commit, add new code while keeping this now-deleted functional code. In the commit message, emphasize newly created redundant functionality (i.e. the code to be deleted).\n\nPart 2) In a following commit, remove the code with redundant functionality.\"",
