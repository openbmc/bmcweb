      "message": "Need to poll the folks looking at this review for a sec;  We need a way to compare version numbers, and every option I can find has some compromise.  The options that I can find are:\n\n1. https://pypi.org/project/packaging/ version.parse.  That\u0027s what the current patchset does, but requires a python dependency that isn\u0027t installed by default, so that needs added to the build script.\n2. distutils.LooseVersion.  Installed by default, so keeps our dependencies down, but gives a warning on using it that distutils is being deprecated soon.\n3. Write/copy our own function.  No dependencies, but requires us to maintain more code.\n\n\nWhat do folks think is the right answer here?",

      "message": "1 or 2. I would prefer we not write our own if there is already solutions out there that works. \n\nBetween 1 or 2, I think I would prefer 1, I think it is reasonable we add that packaging python dependency to the build scripts and require it for anyone running this script locally. It seems widely used and exactly what we want? \n\nRandom Googling seems to indicate movement away from distutils.LooseVersion so I don\u0027t think we should use it.  \nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/17170\n\nI vote 1.",
