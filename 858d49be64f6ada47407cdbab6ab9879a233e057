      "message": "Need to poll the folks looking at this review for a sec;  We need a way to compare version numbers, and every option I can find has some compromise.  The options that I can find are:\n\n1. https://pypi.org/project/packaging/ version.parse.  That\u0027s what the current patchset does, but requires a python dependency that isn\u0027t installed by default, so that needs added to the build script.\n2. distutils.LooseVersion.  Installed by default, so keeps our dependencies down, but gives a warning on using it that distutils is being deprecated soon.\n3. Write/copy our own function.  No dependencies, but requires us to maintain more code.\n\n\nWhat do folks think is the right answer here?",
