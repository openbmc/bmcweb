      "message": "can you please discuss this in the mozilla forum, if you really think this is a concern?  They have far more knowhow and authority to dictate this kind of thing than OpenBMC can.\n\ntestssl.sh is a great tool, and I\u0027ve used it many times on this codebase, but it\u0027s far from an authority that we can base our decisions on like we can with mozilla, nor do they publish any kind of recommendations list, so I don\u0027t see that as being sustainable.  If you want to switch which authority we take our cipher suite and TLS direction from, I\u0027m happy to discuss it, but that\u0027s a different discussion than what you have here.\n\nAlso, \"I am more skeptical\" is hardly a good engineering justification for this.  More details on why it\u0027s needed are important, especially for something that might have impact on users.",
