      "message": "Can you add more here? You appear to be fixing a bug in bmcweb, a Redfish validator error but from this commit msg, I would have no idea. You mention Asset interface (D-Bus interface) but I don\u0027t see much for what this actually does in Redfish/why we need this. interface is used for both a D-Bus interface and a Redfish property in your commit msg? Best to call it something like PCIeDevice PCIeInterface if talking about the Redfish\u0027s PCIeInterface complex. \n\nMaybe something more like:\n\n```\nRemove \"Manufacturer\" from PCIeDevice PCIeInterface\n\nRemove Manufacturer from the PCIeDevice\u0027s PCIeInterface and fix the following Redfish validator error: \n\u003cinsert validator error\u003e \n\nThis error is because there is no [\"PCIeInterface\"][\"Manufacturer\"] at https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/PCIeDevice.v1_11_0.json. \n\n\"Manufacturer\" is already part of the root PCIeDevice and is implemented on line 219.\n\nOn the backend \"Manufacturer\" is already part of Asset interface so remove it from PCIeDevice interface in peci-pcie and phosphor-dbus-interface.\n\nphosphor-dbus-interfaces commit:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/61738\n\npeci-pcie commit:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/peci-pcie/+/62256\n\nTested:\n...\n```",
