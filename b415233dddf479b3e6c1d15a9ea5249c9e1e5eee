      "message": "The current code treats null as a positional placeholder in an array-based operations which is more RESTful and user-friendly. The \"fail silently\" behavior supports:\n- Sequential addition: [null, {\"Address\":\"...\"}] when starting empty\n- Graceful handling: [null, null, null] when fewer gateways exist\n- Array-based operations: null acts as positional placeholder, not \n  explicit delete command\n\nCommit message:Encountering a null IPv6 default gateway entry with no\ncorresponding existing gateway resulted in resourceCannotBeDeleted and\nan early return. This caused mixed/null test cases to fail because the\nloop aborted before processing subsequent entries.\n\nThis change modifies the behavior to skip null entries silently:\n- If a matching gateway exists, delete it and advance the iterator.\n- If no gateway exists, simply continue without error.\n- After processing all input entries, delete any remaining gateways\n  not present in the input array.\n\nThis ensures that scenarios with nulls, empty objects, and clear-all\noperations are handled consistently, without prematurely failing.",
