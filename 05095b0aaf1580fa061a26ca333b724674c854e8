      "message": "Should this be for the content-type mime-type of \"text/html\" regardless of any additional content-type directives?\nIn other words, can we change this to contentType.startsWith(\"text/html\").\n\nI am worried that a network scanner will request URI / with a slightly different content-type, such as \"text/html; charset\u003dUTF-8\" (space added).  As coded in this patchset, this will cause bmcweb to omit various repsonse headers.  then the scanner will flag security issues.\n\nI am not an HTML expert and did not find the answer in https://jazz07.rchland.ibm.com:13443/jazz/web/projects/CSSD#action\u003dcom.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem\u0026id\u003d603937",
