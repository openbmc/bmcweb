      "message": "nit: on line `1058` you have the same thing with a different name\n\n```\n constexpr std::array\u003cstd::string_view, 1\u003e interfaces{\n            \"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Dimm\"};\n```\n\nIMO it would be more consistent to either\n- use the same variable name for the same thing (e.g. `dimmInterfaces`)\n- extract that outside the function, similar to `memoryInterfaces`\n\nThis will make it easier to search for places where the collection (not the single interface) is used throughout this file.\n\nI\u0027ll mark this as resolved since it\u0027s such a minor concern. Maybe something to think about if another revision is required due to a real (not nitpick) issue with the code.",
