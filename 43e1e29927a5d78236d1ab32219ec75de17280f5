We\u0027ve also seen cases where that optimized better when we inlined the strings.\n\nIf this is a reformatting you\u0027d like to do, lets take it up in another patch, separate from adding ipv6 dhcp support, and we can discuss the advantages, but putting them both together is causing me trouble reviewing what the functional diff is because basically every call site has changed.",
