      "message": "Glad to see this stuff being moved forward;  Can we talk a little bit about the long term plans here?  Having this kind of code that directly manipulates the filesystem in bmcweb breaks the OpenBMC architecture in kind of unfortunate ways.  Per the other handlers, the business logic for this should be going into its own daemon and schema, which IBM can maintain, and bmcweb can just call the dbus interface to like we would anything else, which would remove me from most of the management console lock code reviews, and let ibm implement their business logic however they wanted ðŸ˜Š\n\nCan we discuss timeframes on when/how that changeover can happen?  Considering that we\u0027re doing non-trivial business logic updates in this patch series, it seems like a good time to put together a long term plan for this code.",

I think that timeframe is more realistic than a timeframe like end of the year. \n\n\u003e Just wait until we get the architecture corrected, then merge the business logic updates when the IBM daemon is complete?\n\nCould we merge these business logic changes for now?

I\u0027m reading the above as \"We can\u0027t even start this for 12-18 months, but we can do a bunch of other stuff right now\" which really kinda feels like a push off, I\u0027m sure that wasn\u0027t the intent.  I really do think you guys would move faster with your own application.  There\u0027s things like the an RAII object needing to explicitly call close that I don\u0027t understand, but because it\u0027s in a user facing application, i kind of do need to understand it if it\u0027s truly a problem we need to fix elsewhere (I really suspect it\u0027s not).  If it\u0027s in a separate app, go wild.  I kind of assumed this management console stuff was dead, given that I haven\u0027t seen many updates to it.\n\nIs there a path where we can do incremental progress, so you can get your patches merged, and we can make progress toward a better end solution, where IBM can maintain their application and interfaces the same as we would any other application.  Something like:\nFirst business logic change on bmcweb\nphosphor-dbus-interfaces defined and pushed\nsecond business logic change on bmcweb\nRepo requested and created\nthird business logic change in bmcweb\ndaemon created and ready for bmcweb port.\n\nThat way you can make progress, and in the end, we end up with a solution that looks like the rest of the system.\n\n\u003e I think commenting out the option with a notice to remove if we pass that date is also reasonable. \n\nThat doesn\u0027t seem reasonable to me;  If I have to do that, we\u0027ve failed.  Even when I did it in the virtual media case, it didn\u0027t have the desired effect, so it\u0027s not clear that pattern helps people to contribute.",
