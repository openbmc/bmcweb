      "message": "A couple things to consider:\n1. Implementations are allowed to define OEM parameters, or might support a newer version of Redfish protocol than the aggregator, so if we\u0027re going to remove the redfish-supported query params, we should only remove the ones we know that don\u0027t play well.\n2. I\u0027d really like to understand why this is failing.\nThe check here:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/079360ae6e04d3f2245e00d70f83d15c5cad3630/redfish-core/include/utils/query_param.hpp#L569\n\nShould prevent the duplicated expansion of a navigation reference, because any filled in resource will have more keys than just @odata.id.",
