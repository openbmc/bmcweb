This is going to significantly change the cache loading of the router, as what existed there was done on purpose to reduce the cache misses for the hot path (ie searching for a URI).\n\nCan you walk me through why this was required?  It would seem like the flattened node structure would\u0027ve still worked, and this was just an extra cleanup.",

      "message": "I thought about making it 2 patches. But I found it is hard to explain the reason why we need the first patch until it reaches second patch of adding priority. \n\nI can make it a separate patch if you think it is more clear. \n\nThe reason of the refactor is that, priority belongs to rule and routing algorithm(find) belongs to trie. In order to implement priority search/find, rule needs to be visible to Tire. \n\nFor the previous implement, both rule (vector) and trie are parallel member variables of router. So when trie need to visit rule for priority, it has to claim its ownership by router then redirect to rule with vector index. \n\nGiven that trie and router are two individual class, I believe it is a bad practice to add a router*/router\u0026 to trie to claim the ownership. Making rule belongs to Trie makes more sense.",
