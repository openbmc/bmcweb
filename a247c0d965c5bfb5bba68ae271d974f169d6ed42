      "message": "If you stretch the definition of multi-host a bit, it\u0027s a multi-host \nsystem with `n \u003d\u003d 1` hosts. It\u0027s a matter of perspective and configuration i guess.\n\nOverall i have limited options for testing since i don\u0027t have a functional multi-host hardware with `n \u003e 1` hosts.\n\nWhich is why i sometimes get creative with using whatever hw is available to me.\n\nI understand this behavior increases maintainer load, but that development approach (no access to real multi-host hw) is not something i can influence from my side.\n\nTesting with qemu yv4 would also be an option here but it does not make a difference for this specific bug and the qemu yv4 is pretty slow. Which means it\u0027s hard to run the full Tree Redfish Service Validator.",
