This is a header, not a compile unit, so .cpp isn\u0027t correct\n2. We need some way to differentiate ConnectionImpl from Connection.  If we named this websocket.cpp, that could conflict if we ever moved Connection and methods to a compile unit.\n\nIs there another name you could suggest that captures that this is a \"ConnectionImpl\". My thought process here was\n\nConnection -\u003e lives in websocket.hpp\nConnectionImpl -\u003e can live in websocket_impl.hpp",
