Rather than searching on \"Name\", I think we should be searching on \"Id\" and leaving the value escaped, because chassisId is the ID of the chassis, not the Name of the chassis (even though they\u0027re similar).\n\nIf you do that, does the work for your use case?",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I agree that\u0027s a different change.  inventoryItem.name in this case is comparing an Id.  You\u0027re duplicating the \"convert ID to Name\" code when you do the replace.  I\u0027m not asking for a rewrite, i\u0027m asking if you change one string, in a simpler change than what is proposed in this patch, does it fix the issue?\n\nSpecifically i\u0027m asking if you put:\n\nif (powerSupply[\"Id\"] \u003d\u003d inventoryItem.name)\n\nwould that also solve the bug, and be much simpler?  If not, that\u0027s ok, we can work on the patch you proposed.",
