In addition, we\u0027ll have to answer the question \"why is my ThermalSubsystem schema empty?\".\n\nI do see that someone has picked up https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/65286 again, so my preference would be to wait for that to get cleaned up and corrected before this merges.\n\nIf we want to check this in in such a way that it\u0027s not enabled until it does something, and has a date to be deleted, under an\n```\nif constexpr (false)\n```\n\nI\u0027m happy to talk about that, but I really don\u0027t think this function should be enabled until it does something useful.",
