In addition, we\u0027ll have to answer the question \"why is my ThermalSubsystem schema empty?\".\n\nI do see that someone has picked up https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/65286 again, so my preference would be to wait for that to get cleaned up and corrected before this merges.\n\nIf we want to check this in in such a way that it\u0027s not enabled until it does something, and has a date to be deleted, under an\n```\nif constexpr (false)\n```\n\nI\u0027m happy to talk about that, but I really don\u0027t think this function should be enabled until it does something useful.",

      "message": "\u003e Why? \n\n1.This is the correct direction \n\n1a. Thermal Metrics is something that is wanted ( a child of the new  PowerSubsystem/ThermalSubsystem schemas and has the TemperatureReadings, it is something we had in the old Power/Thermal) \n\n1b. I see OpenBMC / all companies on OpenBMC moving to the new PowerSubsystem/ThermalSubsystem in the future\n\n2.So get this small building block merged and off the reviews, maybe more focus will come to 65286\n\n\u003e  \"why is my ThermalSubsystem schema empty?\"\n\nSure, I guess we might get this question.\n\nThat is fine, we can wait on 65286, that would be the normal protocol here.\n\nAlso, fair that if we merge this no guarantee someone gets in 65286",
