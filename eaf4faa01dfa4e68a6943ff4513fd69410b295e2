What user impacts there will be by combining these.\n3. What features will no longer work once these are combined.\n4. Testing that we\u0027ll do to combine these.\n\n\n\nOverall, I don\u0027t see anything that actually documents or tests user impact, and looking at the series, there will be significant impact to the user-facing API.  That needs documented, discussed, and probably put behind an option flag so users can get the old behavior if they want it.",
