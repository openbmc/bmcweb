      "message": "Somewhere, ideally in the first patch in the series, we need a better commit message about:\n\n1. Why these are being combined.\n2. What user impacts there will be by combining these.\n3. What features will no longer work once these are combined.\n4. Testing that we\u0027ll do to combine these.\n\n\n\nOverall, I don\u0027t see anything that actually documents or tests user impact, and looking at the series, there will be significant impact to the user-facing API.  That needs documented, discussed, and probably put behind an option flag so users can get the old behavior if they want it.",
