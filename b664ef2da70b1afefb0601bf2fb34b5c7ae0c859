I appreciate you asking.  I would only ask that you write some unit tests to make sure the behavior stays consistent.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e So I would have sortJsonArrayByOData() call with \"@odata.id\" as key.

It\u0027ll be interesting if we looked into whether ordering by URL is technically correct in all cases, but it should be close enough and if we find a degenerate case we\u0027ll iterate.",
