Service is still operational. \"error\" should be used for unexpected conditions that prevented bmcweb from fulfilling the request. \"error\" shall be used for 5xx errors.\nwarning: A condition occurred that is outside the expected flows, but isn\u0027t necessarily an error in the webserver, or might only be an error in certain scenarios.
