That seems error prone for a number of reasons.\n\n1. Entries are going to be duplicated (because both rely on the journal as a \"source\" or backing.\n2. Rollover is going to happen incorrectly, as the dbus based events are going to roll over in a different pile than the rsyslog based events.\n3. We\u0027re going to have a mix of messages that have a proper MessageId, and those that don\u0027t.  One of the expectations when the rsyslog is used is that every entry has a proper MessageId.\n4. EventService eventing won\u0027t work for the non-rsyslog based events.\n\n\nHave you checked that paging works properly when the values are intermixed?",
