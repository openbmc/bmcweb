I worry about alerting tool that are using bmcweb/redfish to monitor for critical systems will have to change based on this behavior change in bmcweb. \nThat said, it does not hurt us, so if Ed is good, I am good.

      "message": "Johns point is a good one.  A power supply missing, is missing.  The criticality of it being missing is something that needs more subtle handling and is largely dependent on things not in the power supply.  I thought we solved a bunch of this in James code for parsing out the redundancy information and determining the number of failures and whether it was critical.  I\u0027m assuming you looked at that?",
