You are trying to make clang-16 work with the locks? 99.9% of the time (this included), 5 words is not enough of a commit msg. :) \n\nLooks like you removed the \n    BMCWEB_LOG_ERROR\n        \u003c\u003c \"This code is disabled due to clang-tidy issues that prevent CI \"\n           \"from passing.\";\n    std::terminate();\n\nCan you add a link to\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/commit/26b3630b181d1093483e4d5ebe6aeeb91a6a2976 \nexplaining why this was added (e.g. to move to clang-16, std::terminate was added). \n\nI thought there were plans to move this to D-Bus, I am fine with this commit but can you please comment on future plans?",
