      "message": "I am now confused.. Why is this needed for LocationIndicatorActive commit ?.. Also, it\u0027s not an Inventory item type, but of type Control.\n\nLooks like the whole framework has been changed since set:65 and that is clearly not needed for \"LocationIndicatorActive\".\n\nI would leave it to the maintainers.. but I am not looking at fixing all the old issues in one commit in the name of led support, I would like a new commit of its own to fix something that is unrelated to led.",
