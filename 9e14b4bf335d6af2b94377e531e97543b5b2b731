      "message": "since bmcweb has it\u0027s own logging functions, does it make sense to make a special one which prints under the condition that something like `--verbose` is passed to the bmcweb commandline?\n\nSomething like `BMCWEB_LOG_VERBOSE`\n\nHaving such a facility would avoid creating bit rot here and solve the use-case of \u0027we have logs which are seldom useful\u0027\n\nOtherwise a meson option or the old `static bool debug` could also solve it without hiding this code from parsing + typechecking stage.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not really interested in supporting such a CLI argument.  The problem of bit rot in these doesn\u0027t seem like it will be much of an issue in practice if they\u0027re commented out.\n\nIf we want to have some kind of per-subsystem logging, that\u0027s something we should look at holistically, but I\u0027m not that interested in it.  99% of the time I turn on the max log level to debug an issue, or promote a suspected log statement up to ERROR.  It\u0027s relatively rare that there are so many log statements that I need to drop the verbosity down.\n\nIf your or other peoples experience differ, I\u0027m happy to have that discussion;  I\u0027m not interested in implementing something complex for this here.",

      "message": "i did not try it, but what about an\n\n```\nif constexpr (false) {\n\tBMCWEB_LOG_DEBUG(\"...\");\n}\n```\n\n, that would rot less and not much effort to implement.\n\nIt\u0027s local to a function and does not need any extra symbol. Also relatively easy to grep for when someone needs to enable these logs.",
