If the server broke the connection, won\u0027t the response code on line 383 fail?\n\nI wonder if on line 381 we need to be checking parser.is_done().  That way if we get a truly truncated response (rather than just the server closing the connection uncleanly, which some servers do)\n\nwe can still hit the error path.\n\nhttps://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/ref/boost__beast__http__parser/is_done.html\n\nSeem reasonable?",

But the connection is broken due to TCP keep_alive timeout. \nThis is happening at TCP layer and is done by any intermediate proxies. \nThe server will not set any HTTP response code in this case. It is kind of an abrupt connection termination. \nSince http_client is not waiting by reading the socket, it is not aware of the connection termination. \nThe http_client get to know about the connection failure when it tries to send next event. \nWhich can happen very long time after the connection termination. So the way to know about the broken coonection  is from error code.\nSslstream truncation is the error we usually get in this case.",
