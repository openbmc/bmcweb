That was some hacked up code copied to PLDMd from phosphor-bmc-code-mgmt which used to look for the images from the same place as BMC updater as BMCWeb used to put it in /tmp/images dir. One of the two daemons used to win race for image, delete it from /tmp/images directory and then drop the image if it was not intended for it. So, that was never the solution which should have been put up upstream in the first go. FYI: This was the patch which added that change to PLDMd https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/pldm/+/45952. Lets not do similar sort of hack solution again.\n\n(CC @patrick@stwcx.xyz).",

The code doesn\u0027t pick the first StartUpdate interface - it picks the only StartUpdate interface (when there is just one - the pldmd app level update) and no Targets are specified.\n\nMy concern is arising from the fact that you are defaulting the behavior to a Multipart image parser by using the same Update interface as a device level updater. What would be the interface if multiple targets are supplied. There is no consensus on the interface for Multipart image parser yet. I see the design from Tom (where he was proposing a Multipart Manager interface) totally changed from what i reviewed last time. I have provided comments on that.\n\nAlso, i see this patch from Rajeev \nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/82235. Looks like design changes are being put up in bits and pieces.\n\nFirst there needs to be a consensus on what would be the Dbus interface for Multipart updater. So, first lets get that.",
