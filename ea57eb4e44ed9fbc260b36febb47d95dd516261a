      "message": "There was a note on the mailing list about  this, \"[Help Required]Unsupported routes and properties present on Redfish Interface\": \n\n\"\n\u003e *For problem #2*\n\n\u003e We have a use case where certain platform supports multiple redfish Chassis resource and only on few of redfish Chassis resource we want to populate Links.ComputerSystems . As per redfish schema Links.ComputerSystems is not mandatory property as for Chassis resource these are the only required fields which we are adhering to.\n\nYeah, I think we should use associations for Redfish Links. We have been documenting associations in PDI. I think that is a great place to start.\n\nE.g. https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/commit/36b527af49cf87d0bc7097ea6faba4904fbf8878\n\"\n\nI think we should use associations and start by documenting them in phosphor-dbus-interfaces. \nAlthough showing all the chassis is maybe more correct, as shown by the email we have implementations that want to be able to show chassis that belong to the system and that might not be all of the chassis. This also sets us up much better for multiple system support",

But as what I found about associations, a system (and a manager BMC - Managers also need a link to chassis) needs to have a Dbus object path to create an association, right?

      "message": "Hello, I am currently authoring some patches regarding multi-host and also search for a solution to handle the chassis correctly. I have looked into your patch, but this approach  unfortunately would not work for multi-host. Your approach would link every found chassis to each host. Meaning, requesting /redfish/v1/Systems/{system1} on a yosemite4 server would link to chassis1, chassis2, .., chassisN. But we really would want system1 to only link to chassis1 for this specific request as per specification. I think as @gunnar@gmills.xyz already pointed out, the only viable solution would be to use associations. Since I already spent some time on this topic, I could offer to update EM to use associations for the chassis and keep you updated. I am not sure though how fast we can transition, because this change does affect every machine.. @gunnar@gmills.xyz , @ed@tanous.net is this something that should be started with a design doc?",
