Out of an abundance of not wanting to see a gazillion merge conflicts if this doesn\u0027t merge quickly, I\u0027m going to get this on master, because the changes look reasonable to me.  If there are any post-merge comments, either I will personally put up fixes, or work with Patrick to get them fixed.  Feel free to review further, but merging quickly to avoid conflicts.",
