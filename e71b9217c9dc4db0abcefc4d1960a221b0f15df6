Will review better once this is broken down and not a 1300 line patchset.\n\nYou\u0027ll need to talk to your nvidia rep to get added to the Nvidia CLA.  Also, while you\u0027re waiting for that, I\u0027d recommend running the CI tests from openbmc-build-scripts.  I see several issues that CI will immediately catch once you get on the list, and there\u0027s no sense in you waiting for CI that long.",
