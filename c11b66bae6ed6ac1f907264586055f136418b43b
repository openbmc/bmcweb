(A) Delete the bmcweb_redirect socket and start bmcweb without it?  (B) Create a dummy bmcweb_redirect socket that has no network connection and restart bmcweb using that socket?\n\nTo clarify, I foresee three configuration states for the redirect feature:\n1. compiled out of the image,\n2. compiled into the image but disabled by the bmc admin, and\n3. compiled into the image and enabled.\n\nThis comment is asking about a technical mechanism to move between states 2 and 3 above.

This is the intent of service mgr (which I haven\u0027t really followed to see if it made it to mainline).  It is designed to be able to modify socket files to modify ports that services use.\n\nI think all 3 use cases are covered if we add a compile option.  The only part where this gets hairy is with the ENABLE_HTTPS flag.  That flag has been broken for a bit, so I\u0027m wondering if nobody uses it anymore.",

      "message": "I wonder how we can improve that?  All of boost is documented, I only understand it from reading the documentation.  How do you think we can incentivize others to do the same?  Technically the code didn\u0027t compile with all options as it was written, so there were indications that it was incorrect in the type system.  We could document every design decision, but that seems like it would get out of date fast.\n\nSome of this is that the fuzzing hasn\u0027t been set up yet, so it\u0027s really hard to see a breakage to something that doesn\u0027t exist.  I\u0027m working on it though (slowly).  Once I get it turned on, I\u0027m hoping bmcweb development will go much faster and smoother, given that we\u0027ll have automation to catch a lot of things.",
