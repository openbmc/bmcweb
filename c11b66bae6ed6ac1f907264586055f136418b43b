      "message": "Would it be possible for a BMC admin to disable this feature as needed to enhance their security posture?  If so, how?  (A) Delete the bmcweb_redirect socket and start bmcweb without it?  (B) Create a dummy bmcweb_redirect socket that has no network connection and restart bmcweb using that socket?\n\nTo clarify, I foresee three configuration states for the redirect feature:\n1. compiled out of the image,\n2. compiled into the image but disabled by the bmc admin, and\n3. compiled into the image and enabled.\n\nThis comment is asking about a technical mechanism to move between states 2 and 3 above.  But I am not asking to provide that feature.",

That seems to satisfy the basic requirement, but note it is different from the awk-based implementation here: https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-misc/tree/master/http-redirect that redirects any of its explicitly enumerated routes.\nThis code looks okay, but I am not a web server expert.",
