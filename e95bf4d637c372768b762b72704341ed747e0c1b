      "message": "Yeah, I didn\u0027t rename meson options but just macros, which is supposed to be hidden by meson.\n\nThe reason why I made this change is that I will have a follow up patch which attempts to enable \"authz\" without \"authn\". On top of my head, it will be an another insecure option (\"insecure-delegate-authn-keep-authz\"). The use case is our gRPC wrapper, which does all the authn work. The gRPC codes will then tell bmcweb the \"Redfish role\" of the authenticated user.",
