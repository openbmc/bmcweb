      "message": "This is a registry, which means that it shouldn\u0027t be changing as the result of a dbus call, it should be fixed for a given system, which means it can simply be checked in as a static file, or multiple static files for the various configs we support, and should require calling no code (or possibly minimal code to select the right registry).\n\nConsidering this registry will be different between Intel, AMD, ARM and IBM systems, giving them them all the same name, namespace, and version seems like a problem when it comes to Redfish, as it is incorrect as two systems would report the same version and name for the attribute registry, but different available attributes.\n\nI haven\u0027t followed this very closely so I appologize for the late mediocre news.  Was there a design doc on this where we talked about this?  Do you have a design for the versioning and multiple systems problem?  If so, can you link the design review?",
