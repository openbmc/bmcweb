I guess it\u0027s because it has comments not marked as \"resolved\".\nSo what is the usual course of actions the OpenBMC maintainers expect from the contributors? Who is supposed to mark a comment as \"resolved\", the one who made the comment after verifying it\u0027s taken care of or the one who commits a new changeset that is /supposed/ to account whatever the comment was made for?\nI\u0027d be willing to add a clear note regarding this to ``openbmc-docs`` but for that I need to understand what the maintainers\u0027 expectations currently are.",
