I guess it\u0027s because it has comments not marked as \"resolved\".\n\nPer gerrit process, you\u0027re right;  In practice, most maintainers (myself included) aren\u0027t sticklers for it.\n\n\u003e So what is the usual course of actions the OpenBMC maintainers expect from the contributors? Who is supposed to mark a comment as \"resolved\", the one who made the comment after verifying it\u0027s taken care of or the one who commits a new changeset that is /supposed/ to account whatever the comment was made for?\n\nIn theory, you if you implemented a change to fix this, or me if we discussed and I now believe that comment to be a non issue.  Again, this is all in theory.\n\n\u003e I\u0027d be willing to add a clear note regarding this to ``openbmc-docs`` but for that I need to understand what the maintainers\u0027 expectations currently are.\n\nFWIW, this whole \"your turn\" and tracking individual comments in the UI is relatively new in the last gerrit update.  I don\u0027t think we have official policy on it yet, or enough seat time with it to come up with one.",
