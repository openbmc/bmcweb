      "message": "\u003e why do we only put this in system? I suppose this should put in http_connection where every resource gets the default only handler.\n\nThis is called out in the commit message;  I only put it in system at the moment because I was hoping that there was a better pattern we could use before I propagated this in the 100 places in the tree it needs to be.  If you have a better idea of how to do this, I\u0027m all ears.\n\nIt can\u0027t go in http_connection, because\n1: This is not a transport abstraction, it\u0027s a resource one.\n2: HttpConnection is a common class for all requests, not JUST redfish, so we can\u0027t inject redfish specific stuff into, say, the dbus-rest or kvm trees.\n\n\nIf someone has a better pattern for how to do this.... please, speak up, otherwise, I\u0027m planning on propagating this pattern throughout the tree.\n\n\nOne thing I realize today is it does make the \"optimized expand\" stuff a lot easier, because in the future we can just make an overload of this that can return the query struct, and callers that opt in can take a look at the query before they execute things.  So there\u0027s pros and cons.",
