I suppose this should put in http_connection where every resource gets the default only handler.\n\nThis is called out in the commit message;  I only put it in system at the moment because I was hoping that there was a better pattern we could use before I propagated this in the 100 places in the tree it needs to be.  If you have a better idea of how to do this, I\u0027m all ears.\n\nIt can\u0027t go in http_connection, because\n1: This is not a transport abstraction, it\u0027s a resource one.\n2: HttpConnection is a common class for all requests, not JUST redfish, so we can\u0027t inject redfish specific stuff into, say, the dbus-rest or kvm trees.\n\n\nIf someone has a better pattern for how to do this.... please, speak up, otherwise, I\u0027m planning on propagating this pattern throughout the tree.\n\n\nOne thing I realize today is it does make the \"optimized expand\" stuff a lot easier, because in the future we can just make an overload of this that can return the query struct, and callers that opt in can take a look at the query before they execute things.  So there\u0027s pros and cons.",

Really don\u0027t think about putting it in Router::handle()?\n\nRouter::handle() is meant for all HTTP routes, not just Redfish ones.  Keeping this abstraction is important, because there are a number of potential and existing HTTP interfaces that the BMC might handle in the future that aren\u0027t redfish.  If we started enforcing redfish parameters on all http routes, that would be breaking that abstraction layer, and that abstraction layer has allowed bmcweb to survive several interface transitions.\n\nI\u0027ve asked about better ways to solve this on several reviews and on discord, and I haven\u0027t seen anyone propose anything, but if you have an idea, please, put up a patch or a snippet somewhere, and we can evaluate it.
