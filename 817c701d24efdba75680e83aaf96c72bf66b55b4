It\u0027s so far in the noise that it almost doesn\u0027t matter and depends very heavily on compiler versions and generated code compression complexity.\n\n\u003e I have seen a fair amount of bugs with these Redfish enums, and I think they will continue in the future (e.g., I have seen multiple simple bugs around spelling and capitalization of Redfish Enums).\n\u003e This is also another thing reviewers don\u0027t have to worry as much about.  \n\u003e \n\u003e This adds more files and another generate script, but I think the pros outweigh the cons (with the main con being the increase in binary size).\n\n+1\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Full disclosure, IBM is less concerned with binary size due to larger flash on its latest machines.

Out of curiosity, does IBM not plan to ever update their old systems against CVEs?  (for example the most recent one).  Having a large binary size would prevent upgrading older platforms.",
