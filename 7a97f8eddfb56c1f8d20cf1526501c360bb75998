      "message": "This is a WIP. I am trying to figure out:\n1. How to automatically force the page to refresh after the mtls session is intercepted and the cookie is injected.\n2. Currently I have a single bool which is tracking if this connection has been intercepted previously. If so, it does not attempt to intercept it again. Is there a better way to handle this? I wanted to check the cookies, but I couldn\u0027t figure out a good way to do that in crow.\n3. webui requires the username to be stored in local storage. To my knowledge, this is not something I can inject from bmcweb, so I believe this will require a change to webui?",

      "message": "FYI, I\u0027ve played around with this flow a little.  What I suspect is that we now need to implement the Redfish property AccountService. RespondToUnauthenticatedClients\n\nAnd use that to control the switch inside http_connection.  Redfish added this recently, and in theory that would allow a client to simply control the behavior, rather than trying to sort out something that works in all cases.",
