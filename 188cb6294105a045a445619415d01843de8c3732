      "message": "\u003e We do this because it\u0027s generated by gitignore.io.\n\nYes. I also used gitignore.io and generated a new gitignore. That\u0027s what you see in this patch.\n\n\u003e I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s all commented out,\n\nMy understanding is people should uncomment lines that they need. In this project, I don\u0027t expect people use Gradle or Maven, so why do we keep those commented settings?\n\n\u003e but there are those in the project that use intellij and clion, so can we please leave it as gitignore has it\n\nI didn\u0027t delete CLion. I use both CLion and Pycharm. I have verified no weird settings are kept after this change.\n\nWhy do we want to keep unused codes at all? If in the future magically we have Java codes in this project, we can always go to gitignore.io, generate Gradle and Maven gitignore settings, and add them back, right?\n\n\u003e It looks like the current one doesn\u0027t comment these out, so that seems like the appropriate thing to do.\n\nWhat do you mean? If you go to https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/osx,linux,clion,meson,pycharm,eclipse,windows,intellij,visualstudio,visualstudiocode, the lines I deleted in this patch are still commented.",
