Is it for event service?  your commit message is your opportunity to explain WHY you did what you did.  As written I can see from your patch that you added something to the registry, I don\u0027t need it duplicated here, but what we as maintainers need is why you added it, and what you\u0027re hoping to accomplish with it.",
