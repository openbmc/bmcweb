The intent originally is that this disambiguation should be pushed onto the individual DBus daemon implementations, such that non-complicated systems can have simple naming (pcie1, pcie2, etc) and complex systems can do complicated schemes like what you proposed (chassisN_io_moduleN_slotN_adapterN).  In this way, the system itself can decide if the PCIe devices should be.  bmcweb should not be making that decision.",
