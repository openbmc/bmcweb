Otherwise someone could request `/redfish/v1/Systems/NotASystem` and it is going to attempt something, isn\u0027t it?  Should the `getComputerSystemIndex` do some verification and return an empty string if the name isn\u0027t \"systemN\"?  I didn\u0027t see any code in `getComputerSystemIndex` that explicitly picked off the integer portion.  Was that missing?",
