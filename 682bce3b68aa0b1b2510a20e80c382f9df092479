      "message": "Note that uses the same approach as what readUrlSegments() from http/utility.hpp uses under the hood.  It make more sense to me to break it out here rather than create a separate utility since this is the only location it is used and it relies on lookup via topCollections.\n\nThe other option I could think of is create an aggregation utility file that\u0027s separate from the aggregation_utils.hpp generated by scripts/generate_schema_collections.py.  In this other utility file I\u0027d put aggregation specific versions of readUrlSegments() and replaceUrlSegment().  I\u0027d probably also move as much of the prefix fixing code as possible.\n\nMy preference is to keep as much of the aggregation code as possible within redfish_aggregator.hpp, but I\u0027m open to changing if any reviewers feel strongly about it.",
