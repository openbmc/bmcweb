      "message": "This has some performance and safety implications.  If an outside user can cause an ERROR trace to happen, it\u0027s much easier to DOS attack the BMC.  Have you measured any of that?\n\nAlso, we\u0027re not very careful with when we use ERROR and when we use informational.  Someone would need to audit all of our uses, and ensure that those levels ONLY occurred on internal to the bmc problems, not on bad user data, which I don\u0027t think is the case today.",
