I mean, if the DBus has the `xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Accuracy` interface and the Accuracy value is equal to NAN, then the `\"Accuracy\": null` will be displayed in redfish, is this expected?\n\nI\u0027m not sure, hopefully Ed or Gunnar can answer that.  I\u0027d recommend whatever behavior is expected for other interfaces.",
