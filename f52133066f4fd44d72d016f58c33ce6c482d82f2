      "message": "Because we\u0027re opening pandoras box here, lets move toward the correct, typesafe APIs using operator/\u003d.  I allowed these in in the first place because to_string on a uint64 is technically always representable as a dbus path for all values, and I didn\u0027t want to slow you guys down, but if we\u0027re going to go the route of technical correctness, we need to be using typesafe object_path objects.\n\nflushing these through std::format is one level too removed from being able to obviously see that these don\u0027t need escaped.",

Do you think this alternative would be better?\n\n\n```suggestion\n{\n    const sdbusplus::message::object_path settingsPath(std::format(\n        \"/xyz/openbmc_project/control/host{}/boot\",\n        computerSystemIndex));\n```\n\nFrom my perspective it is a tiny bit better since we have one less variable to go around.\n\nIf you agree with it that could be applied throughout the patch.",
