Do you think this alternative would be better?\n\n\n```suggestion\n{\n    const sdbusplus::message::object_path settingsPath(std::format(\n        \"/xyz/openbmc_project/control/host{}/boot\",\n        computerSystemIndex));\n```\n\nFrom my perspective it is a tiny bit better since we have one less variable to go around.\n\nIf you agree with it that could be applied throughout the patch.",
