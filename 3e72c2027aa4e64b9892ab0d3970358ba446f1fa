      "message": "Hello,\n\nI understand I\u0027m late to the party but probably someone can still clarify please.\n\nHow is this supposed to be used with remotely authenticated users, e.g. with LDAP?\n```\n# busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.User.Manager /xyz/openbmc_project/user xyz.openbmc_project.User.Manager GetUserInfo s ldap_sync\na{sv} 2 \"RemoteUser\" b true \"UserPrivilege\" s \"priv-admin\"\n```\nAs you can see `UserGroups` array isn\u0027t present in the reply at all in this case. This leads to a regression where previously LDAP/RADIUS/whatever-authenticated users could use SOL and now they can not (even worse, the web interface terminates the session on attempt as it gets 401 reply trying to upgrade connection to WS).\n\nAlso, why is host serial console access permission treated in a way that differs from IP KVM access? Aren\u0027t implications about the same in most scenarios? Is there a document somewhere describing the rationale behind this change?",

The fact that this has been checked in for over a year and nobody has reported LDAP issues somewhat backs that up.\n\nWell, I\u0027m reporting it now. Can say after that minimal fix to webui (to assume Administrator for remote users) it\u0027s quite usable without tricks or tweaks.\n\n\u003e I would assume that this is just a bug in phosphor-user-manager that needs fixed.\n\nAFAICT the LDAP support was designed under assumption that every user has just a primary group assigned and that primary group is mapped to Administrator/Operator/ReadOnly and that\u0027s it. It used to work nicely enough and it still can work but this patch I\u0027m commenting introduced a regression.\n\nRequiring extending not only phosphor-user-manager, bmcweb and webui-vue (for adding `GroupsAttribute`) to implement support for multiple groups but also probably the LDAP schema and actual database (at the clients\u0027!) looks like something that breaks compatibiliity with existing installs way too much.\n \n\u003e \u003e Also, why is host serial console access permission treated in a way that differs from IP KVM access?\n\u003e \n\u003e Because people want to treat them differently, and Redfish treats them separately.\u0027\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e Aren\u0027t implications about the same in most scenarios?\n\u003e \n\u003e possibly.  There might be cases where the serial console is more locked down than KVM (or vice versa) so some admins might give access to one or the other.  It\u0027s probably also something to do with \"Principal of least privilege\".\n\nThen those people can please share their document called \"Threat Model\" so one could verify whether the implementation helps anything at all. Current way of requiring additional local group to access serial console (and not requiring anything like that for KVM so any Administrator can use it) is likely to not limit potential attacker anyhow as many modern popular setups (e.g. RHEL or Windows Server) do not even enable any control over serial by default but provide full control over KVM.\n\nSo far it looks like the gain is really dubious security-wise while regression is real...",

      "message": "\u003e Well, I\u0027m reporting it now.\n\nYep, that\u0027s fine.  LDAP support goes more to the fact that to my knowledge there\u0027s no way to test it, no instructions on how to set it up, or documentation for others to execute.  That\u0027s fine you\u0027re reporting it;  If your goal is to fix the bug, no need to comment here, just send the patch to fix it.  If your goal is to keep LDAP working in the long term, we either need some way to test it (think a simple script to run or something), or to have someone testing it manually periodically.\n\n\n\u003e looks like something that breaks compatibiliity with existing installs way too much.\n\nWhat does \"installs\" mean in this context?  We have an API, so far as I understand the API backward compatibility support has been maintained.\n\n\u003e Requiring extending not only phosphor-user-manager, bmcweb and webui-vue\n\nphosphor-user-manager support was already added as part of this.  webui-vue support isn\u0027t required (the default is that new users get access to everything I believe).\n\nI could certainly see the argument that this should be a 403 forbidden (because the login was valid), not a 401 unauthorized.  That\u0027s something we could pretty trivially fix.  I actually don\u0027t even see where we\u0027re sending 401 from for serial websockets, so I\u0027ll need you to propose that change if you have ldap set up and can see where it\u0027s setting 401.\n\n\n\u003e Then those people can please share their document called \"Threat Model\"\n\nI said nothing about threat model, so I\u0027m not sure why you made that leap or why it would be required in this case.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege is what I was referring to, and involves those that don\u0027t need access to a serial console should not have access to it, regardless of whether or not it changes the threat model.\n\n\u003e RHEL or Windows Server\n\nI would say the majority of OpenBMC installs aren\u0027t running either of these, so I\u0027m not sure where the comparison comes from.  At the end of the day, someone thought it was a useful enough feature for them that they went to a lot of effort to do it and upstream it.  The feature might not be useful to you, which is fine, but that\u0027s a different discussion.\n\n\n\n\nAll of this feedback it great, but you haven\u0027t really stated what you\u0027d like to see happen here.",
