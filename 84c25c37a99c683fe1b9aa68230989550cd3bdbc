      "message": "My suggested fix is in the comment below.  The net result seems reasonable, I just don\u0027t like posting back \"*******\" because it\u0027s a UI thing, and implies we sent back the length of the password (which we didn\u0027t, but it LOOKS like we did).  If the UI wants to turn null into ******, let it do that in the UI, but from a Redfish perspective, we can return null.",
