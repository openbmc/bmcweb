      "message": "Understood, but having 2 different methods of executing the same action, with very different code is far worse than some duplicated, relatively easy to read code.  In most cases, you\u0027ve replaced very easy to understand semantics with utility functions that obfuscate intent, and worse, cause the codebase to have 2 different \"right\" ways to do things.\n\nAt no point did I ask you to change it everywhere in this commit.  I asked you to separate your concerns.  There is nothing in TelemetryService that REQUIRES the constructs you\u0027ve added, and the types of conversions you\u0027re doing have been done in other redfish services many many times.  Also, in a lot of those cases, these utils functions have been discussed and discounted, as they obfuscate and make the code larger, and slower.  I\u0027m suggesting you can either.\n\n1. Push a commit to add the utils functions, and transfer enough of the bmcweb control flow over to those utils that they make the implementation cleaner, and host all the discussions that entails. Then, once that\u0027s merged use another patchset to check in the Telemetry Service implementation.\n2. (preferred) Build telemetry service with the existing abstractions and patterns available in the codebase today.  Then, when you feel comfortable, build the utils functions and transfer them over.\n\nSaid another way, there is nothing technically binding these two together, and they need to be separated in concept.",

You can have the later, and be no worse off.  In fact, following consistent patterns allows developers to develop a mindset around these things.  Randomly changing patterns, destroys a lot of that.  as-is, you\u0027ve made the code readability very very difficult compared to the relatively simpler loop and if/else if statement approach that the other handlers take.\n\n\"It saves us a lot of development effort.

It causes significant development effort for those that have to maintain these constructs in the long run, and even more for the people that have to debug or use these constructs in the future.  Feel free to write the test to prove the performance, but I promise you, more code is being executed using this pattern, more memory is being copied, consumed and moved, and more code is being generated.

What input did you use in the ms duration?\n\nWhen I compile the below test app, using your data point of 4222259626 it returns the correct string (P48DT20H50M59.626S).  It\u0027s surprising that it would have floating point errors, as it uses zero floating point values, and everything in done as ints (which should also help performance in a minor way).
