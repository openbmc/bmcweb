Disabling the interface you\u0027re currently using isn\u0027t a very common operation, and can lead to the possibility of the user locking themselves out of the system, hence why it\u0027s not implemented today.  So lets get your use case understood, then hopefully we can give you some advice about how to proceed.",

If users have a way to disable an interface from said interface, that leaves a user open to accidentally locking themselves out.  That\u0027s why this wasn\u0027t implemented before.  I\u0027d fully support disabling the HTTPS interface over a different API (ipmi, ect) or if we could differentiate enablement based on channels, so it wasn\u0027t possible for a user to lock themselves out of a system, but as written, this patchset seems really dangerous to have.",
