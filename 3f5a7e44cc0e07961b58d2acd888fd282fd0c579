Disabling the interface you\u0027re currently using isn\u0027t a very common operation, and can lead to the possibility of the user locking themselves out of the system, hence why it\u0027s not implemented today.  So lets get your use case understood, then hopefully we can give you some advice about how to proceed.",

The Redfish spec allows it (ManagerNetworkProtocol.json) and some OpenBMC downstream users might want it (specifically, systems that manage their BMC via the host).  I would be okay with this function if I could remove it from my image.  Because (like Ed said) I don\u0027t want to give my users a way to disable HTTPS.\n\nI believe this review is associated with https://github.com/ibm-openbmc/dev/issues/1763 which calls for a way to disable SSH and HTTP and SSH.",
