You\u0027re currently relying on the mapper call, which searched on the interfaces: \"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Board\",\n                \"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item.Chassis\"\n\nThen using that as a proxy to lookup The item interface.  That might be correct in some cases, but definitely not all.  You should be asking the mapper to look up interfaces like this.\n\nThis looks to be an issue on all of these.",
