      "message": "So, interesting question, do we want journald users to be able to set ResourceAdded/ResourceRemoved/ResourceModified events in EventService?  It seems odd that we\u0027d allow that considering that a user on dbus can\u0027t properly construct the Redfish URI for an item, so it seems unlikely they\u0027d be able to do it correctly.\n\n\nI\u0027m assuming this is fixing some existing behavior?  I guess I didn\u0027t even realize we had code that used these registries.",
