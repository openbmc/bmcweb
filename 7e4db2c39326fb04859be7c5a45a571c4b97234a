It requires every daemon to now understand how their states are related to the inventory, which might be \"better\" but it isn\u0027t how we\u0027ve already done things and it is quite a bit of extra code to put in every other daemon.\n\u003e \n\u003e There was already a number of pre-existing design documentation that suggests \"fooN means it is related to hostN\", so we\u0027re leveraging that with the ManagedHost inventory decorator to make it easier for `bmcweb` (as had been previously requested).\n\n\nMost daemons already do this (bind associations to inventory items), so I\u0027m not really following why this is a heavy lift?  Knowing X inventory/log/whatever applies to Y host is an important requirement for the whole ComputerSystems collection, not just power control.  My primary worry here is that we\u0027ve only considered power control in this patch, and there\u0027s not something general that gets us to where the remaining items in computer system collection are multi-host.\n\nThere\u0027s a lot more than Power control in ComputerSystem, and to my understanding the above design would _only_ work for power control.  Just to rehash what was talked about a year ago when this effort started, these are all the URIs under ComputerSystemCollection.  Each needs to have a mechanism to make them multihost before we can remove the experimental option and rely on DBus.\n\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Bios/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Bios/Actions/Bios.ResetBios/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/FabricAdapters/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/FabricAdapters/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Crashdump/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Crashdump/Actions/LogService.ClearLog/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Crashdump/Actions/LogService.CollectDiagnosticData/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Crashdump/Entries/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Crashdump/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Crashdump/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Dump/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Dump/Actions/LogService.ClearLog/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Dump/Actions/LogService.CollectDiagnosticData/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Dump/Entries/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/Dump/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/EventLog/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/EventLog/Actions/LogService.ClearLog/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/EventLog/Entries/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/EventLog/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/EventLog/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/attachment/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/HostLogger/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/HostLogger/Entries/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/HostLogger/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/PostCodes/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/PostCodes/Actions/LogService.ClearLog/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/LogServices/PostCodes/Entries/\u003cstr\u003e/attachment/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Memory/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Memory/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/PCIeDevices/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/PCIeDevices/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/PCIeDevices/\u003cstr\u003e/PCIeFunctions/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/PCIeDevices/\u003cstr\u003e/PCIeFunctions/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Processors/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Processors/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Processors/\u003cstr\u003e/OperatingConfigs/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Processors/\u003cstr\u003e/OperatingConfigs/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/ResetActionInfo/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Storage/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Storage/1/Controllers/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Storage/1/Drives/\u003cstr\u003e/\n/redfish/v1/Systems/\u003cstr\u003e/Storage/\u003cstr\u003e/\n\nIf we\u0027d like to use fixed interface/path naming holistically for all of the above, and have a common system based on names for logs/sensors/power, I\u0027m happy to have that discussion, but to my understanding that\u0027s not what this patch is proposing, it\u0027s _just_ a change to state manager.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e It seems to me, asking for every other daemon to be re-written to incorporate [currently undefined] associations is way outside the scope here and yet another \"go in a different direction now that the code is here\".\n\nGoing back to relying on known dbus object paths, names, or path hiearchy was discussed during https://github.com/openbmc/technical-oversight-forum/issues/18\n\nI don\u0027t think anything has changed since then?",

I was thinking in terms of the earlier versions of this patch set.  https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/72414 was added to satisfy your earlier concerns, and you +1\u0027d the dbus interface.  Now that we\u0027re trying to use it, you want yet another direction...\n\nIssue 18 was specifically scoped to inventory because nobody signed up to fix all the other daemons.\n\n`ComputerSystem.Reset` is handled by this approach.\n`Bios.ResetBios` only works on IBM systems anyhow and the software design already has architecture around \"slots\".\nMost of the elements you posted are Inventory related, which probably work with associations per the issue#18 you posted.\n`Crashdump` design doesn\u0027t handle multi-host at all yet so it is hard to reason about.\n`EventLog` design internals also do not explicitly handle multi-host; there is one big log for the BMC.\n`PostCodes` is handled by this approach.\n`HostLogger` is handled by this approach.\n\nSo, it seems to me like this approach covers most of the necessary end-points beyond just \"state management\".",
