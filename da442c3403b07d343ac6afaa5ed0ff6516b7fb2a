      "message": "Moving it to dbus_utility.hpp is raising a lot of dependency issues, because GetSubTreeType is defined in openbmc_dbus_rest.hpp and to resolve them I\u0027d need to touch upwards of a dozen files.\n\nI\u0027d like to keep this PR focussed on google usecase and clean up later. Added a TODO for the same.\n\nIn retrospect, seems like most other redfish classes like Chassis each have their own way of dealing with ObjectMapper and it would have been nicer if there was a common way of interacting with it like in my PR. Seems like a missed opportunity. Well, hopefully we will get to it at some point.",
