      "message": "I guess some of the issue I have with that is that these are self describing if you understand c++, and including info about how branching works is kinda like teaching c++ in a C++ file.  If we\u0027re documenting everything we didn\u0027t do because it was a bad idea, 80% of the code would be comments.\n\n\nI don\u0027t think we should be in the business of describing the different between an #ifdef and an if statement in a comment.  We could certainly document that every option going forward should be using if() unlesss there\u0027s a good reason not to, but that would go in the developing guide, and I don\u0027t want to make this policy until I get a little seat time with this one option to make sure there aren\u0027t any gotchas over some time.",
