      "message": "Why we need this port for KVM? Port 5900 only accepts connections from localhost (BMC itself). It is unusable by users.\n\nIn our case, bmcweb will act as a proxy which passes the requests/responses between its kvm websocket and port 5900 (where libvncserver listens, since it cannot listen a unix socket, we have to do so).\n\nAnd, enabling/disabling KVM makes no sense from my point. Unlike java-based one which has another port and some private protocol (maybe unencrypted?), OpenBMC\u0027s kvm is just a payload of HTTPS/WSS, it won\u0027t bring extra security issues.",

      "message": "In case KVM, bmcweb act as the proxy and internal KVM port (5900) is not directly used by external user. \n\nBut on high level BMC manageability view, Redfish NetworkProtocol schema is used for providing information to external user about all network ports used - though KVM port is internal only (It\u0027s debatable though). But our thought is to expose those details like below.\n - KVM enabled/disabled - (Read \u0026 write) - This will allow administrator to control the feature (like enable/disable KVM)\n - KVM Port (Read only) - (Note: This is mandatory params if redfish is exposing KVM node for feature enable/disable functionality)\n\nIf you disagree with above, Do you think is there away exist today to enabled/Disable KVM feature (Which not only controls KVM feature but also free up the port 5900)?",

      "message": "I disagree.  The intent of ManagerNetworkProtocol is to expose the Manager external facing interfaces, not the internal ones.\n\nTo implement the use case you want:\n1. Make sure that KVM is binding to the appropriate interfaces, and not all interfaces, and then the port conflict won\u0027t matter.\n2. To disable KVM needs discussion with DMTF, although I do suspect that this is the right API for your use case.",
