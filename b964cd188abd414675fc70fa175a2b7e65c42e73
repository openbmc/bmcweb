      "message": "Why we need this port for KVM? Port 5900 only accepts connections from localhost (BMC itself). It is unusable by users.\n\nIn our case, bmcweb will act as a proxy which passes the requests/responses between its kvm websocket and port 5900 (where libvncserver listens, since it cannot listen a unix socket, we have to do so).\n\nAnd, enabling/disabling KVM makes no sense from my point. Unlike java-based one which has another port and some private protocol (maybe unencrypted?), OpenBMC\u0027s kvm is just a payload of HTTPS/WSS, it won\u0027t bring extra security issues.",
