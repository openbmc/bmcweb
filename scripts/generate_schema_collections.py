# Script to generate top level resource collection URIs
# Parses the Redfish schema to determine what are the top level collection URIs
# and writes them to a generated .hpp file as an unordered_set.  Also generates
# a map of URIs that contain a top level collection as part of their subtree.
# Those URIs as well as those of their immediate children as written as an
# unordered_map.  These URIs are need by Redfish Aggregation
