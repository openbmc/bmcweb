      "message": "It\u0027s what most of the rest of the project is using, is already available, and is pretty much the standard goto choice for c++ log formatting.  I also considered printf/varargs forwarding, but that has its own issues.\n\nOpen to other ideas though.\n\nOne thing that I considered after I wrote this was to use spdlog directly instead of our own logging class.  I\u0027m not sure the binary-size consequences of that, but it might be worth it to not have our own logging class.  With that said, the logging class is a trivial amount of code, so even if we went with that approach, I\u0027d probably still do it in two steps.",
