There are pretty significant unit tests in the next commit.\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/52272/26/redfish-core/include/utils/query_param_test.cpp\n\nIt didn\u0027t make sense to me to make a reviewer review a partial unit test, then review a bunch of edits to the exact same unit tests.  With that said, if you want them broken up, I can, I just figured reviewing one file of new content was easier.",
