      "message": "Please check the commit https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/45063 where the hypervisor resource and its related network configuration is moved into a condition, where the system supports xyz.openbmc_project.Network.Hypervisor app.\n\nThis dbus app is enabled for IBM systems via https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-networkd/+/43173\n\nThis is done as per Ed\u0027s concern of tying the bmcweb to the Bios manager which is mostly a system specific app, containing the customized bios table attributes.\n\nWith this, i think there is no need to have any build option for this hypervisor feature. Appreciate if you all can have a look at this commit and vote.\n\nBut yes, the commit https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/52075 looks interesting. Our need is to support the ethernet interface schema for the hypervisor(system resource). We will look into this commit and see if this can be extended to support the network config for the hypervisor",
