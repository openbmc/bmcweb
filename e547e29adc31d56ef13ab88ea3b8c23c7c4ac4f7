      "message": "To anyone watching, this change makes Service Config Manager a hard requirement on all systems, but that service is not the default.  That is why this patch series is stuck.  I only see Service Config Manager explicitly added to meta-ibm and meta-amd, so this would break all other platforms, and cause them to return Port: null, ServiceEnabled: false for all protocols.\n\nThe result is obviously unacceptable, so we either need to make srvcfg-manager enabled on all platforms, or have some fallback, to where we check systemd first, and if systemd reports not running THEN we check srvcfg-manager to see if it\u0027s in the process of being started.",

      "message": "FWIW, I rebased these patches, and fixed up the coding errors hoping I could land them, but we need to have a bigger discussion around service config manager.\n\nAs-is, if I enable service config manager, it gets stuck waiting for the system to start, and bmcweb reports all services as unavailable (which isn\u0027t true).  That doesn\u0027t seem like a great failure mode.  We might need to look into that on the service config manager side before this can be enabled everywhere.",
