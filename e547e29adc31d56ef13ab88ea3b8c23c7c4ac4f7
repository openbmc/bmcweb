      "message": "To anyone watching, this change makes Service Config Manager a hard requirement on all systems, but that service is not the default.  That is why this patch series is stuck.  I only see Service Config Manager explicitly added to meta-ibm and meta-amd, so this would break all other platforms, and cause them to return Port: null, ServiceEnabled: false for all protocols.\n\nThe result is obviously unacceptable, so we either need to make srvcfg-manager enabled on all platforms, or have some fallback, to where we check systemd first, and if systemd reports not running THEN we check srvcfg-manager to see if it\u0027s in the process of being started.",
