Arguably that needed to be done before the line on 355 was completed, but lets do it now.  Something like\n```\nfor (interface : interfaces2){\n   if (interface.first \u003d\u003d \"xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.AssetTag\"){\n      ...\n   }\n   else if (interface.first \u003d\u003d ...){\n      ....\n   }\n\n}\n```",
