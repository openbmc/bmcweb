This is going to result in 404 being wrong for the user session case if a user is deleted, but their session still exists.\n\nI guess that\u0027s probably ok, previously we would\u0027ve gotten a 500, but please make sure you\u0027ve tested that path.",

I am not totally sure whether I do it correctly or not, but what I get is that the http status code is 404 after I delete a user\n\nlet me know if you have any concerns! Also I fixed the CI today, it is green now",
