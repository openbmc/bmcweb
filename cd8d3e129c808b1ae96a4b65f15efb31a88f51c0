Redfish is a hypermedia API; there should always be a link from parent to child. We have this today.\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/9970e93f794d0110de436828775e333e81330ad5/redfish-core/include/utils/pcie_util.hpp#L43\n\nThe link from Chassis to /redfish/v1/Systems/system/PCIeDevices is unexpected and worse than that, breaks for \n\n2) This breaks for multiple chassis systems, it assumes all PCIeDevices are in all Chasiss. \n\nWe could have put PCIeDevices under Chassis but they were put under system instead. I can see a case for either, I think Systems is fine though and Redfish gives us a way to link PCIeDevices to a Chassis but it isn\u0027t this, it is Links/Chassis on the PCIeDevice schema.\nRemove this link, one day an association will probably be needed to fill out Links/Chassis on PCIeDevice.\n\n\u003e In addition, can we get an explanation of what clients that relied on this property should do instead?\n\nThe link is still there, it is just in the system resource only now. The case of walking the whole tree isn\u0027t broke. Clients shouldn\u0027t be assuming some link.. We are removing wrong information here.",
