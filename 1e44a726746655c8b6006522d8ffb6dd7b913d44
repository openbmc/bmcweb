      "message": "I am really confused. This header referenced a shared pointer `crow::connections::systemBus` which is declared in the dbus_singleton.hpp. Shouldn\u0027t we include that header which declares the `crow::connections::systemBus`? Otherwise, `crow::connections::systemBus` is unknown and you will get undeclared identifier, right?\n\nI thought about the issue you talked about. The |systemBus| is static and there\u0027s only a single translation unit `src_webserver_main.cpp.o`. So, there is no other copy in the main `bmcweb` binary.\n\nI also believe it is true that every translation unit (e.g., unit tests) needs to define this |systemBus|. But that\u0027s not what this commit introduces. That\u0027s what you need to do anyway. Include the header doesn\u0027t change (which is the correct thing to do as I believe) anything.",
