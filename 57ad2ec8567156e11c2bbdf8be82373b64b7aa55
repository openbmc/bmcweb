Filtering out resolved logEntries doesn\u0027t fix the pagination problem, and arguably makes it worse, because you can actually miss events if they\u0027re resolved faster than your polling interval, unless i\u0027m missing something about your idea.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e Considering that the Resolved field can be changed _after_ the log is created, this messes with pagination.\n\u003e \n\u003e How does it mess with pagination?

This is how most paging collection APIs work.\n\nIf a log that happened in the past has the potential to change, now I can no longer rely on any of the above to get an accurate state of the logs at any give set of time unless the BMC changes the log ID every time the resolved field is changed, which it doesn\u0027t look like it does today.",
