      "message": "Hi Patrick, \nDo you really want these lines to be printed in the journal traces? This is an existing master code, and any later change (clang which came in a day ago here) which comes in may need some changes in the existing code to make it compatible to the new change. That does not mean to use the kind of statements which are mentioned here. \nPlease see if you can let out your concerns in a healthy way.",

I cannot invest the brain cells on this code to come up with one on my own because the code is not reasonable to begin with and this is IBM’s OEM code. \n\nIf no one at IBM proposes a fix, something along these lines will be merged for the sake of the project as a whole. \n\nSure, I could tone down the words here and probably will if this is what we go with.",
