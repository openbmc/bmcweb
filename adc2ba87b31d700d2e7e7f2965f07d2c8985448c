See discussion on the github about what VerifyCertificate is supposed to represent for more details.\nB. Causes a security issue.  SSL verification is set by a user per-subscription, but the connection pooling is currently global for all of bmcweb, so a simple way to bypass verification would be\n\n1. Create a subscription with VerifyCertificate \u003d false\n2. Send a test event.\n3. Create a subscription to the same url with VerifyCertificate \u003d true\n4. send a test event.\n\nThe second event will be sent without certificate verification, which a security problem.",
