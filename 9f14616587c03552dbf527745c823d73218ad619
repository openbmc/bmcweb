Although it probably comes with some breaking changes to non-Admins roles, which hopefully should be limited since most users would still just use root/an admin role?\n\nLets treat that in a different scope, because they\u0027re arguably bugs that should be fixed.  For the things that need weird, non-DMTF behavior we can always fall back to the hardcoded/old way, and ideally we\u0027d be maneuvering toward the \"right\" DMTF way in the long run.",
