      "message": "Can you please talk about why this is being done using a regex parse of source code?  I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a pattern we\u0027ve done elsewhere in the project, and would generally recommend in-language alternatives, or generation of code as opposed to parsing code itself.   Looking at it, it\u0027s going to break every existing bmcweb fork that adds a BMCWEB_ROUTE instance, which doesn\u0027t seem like it tracks with the overall health of the project (people need to be able to fork and write their own code).\n\nIn addition, it looks like the script would need to be rerun on every commit, which I don\u0027t think was set up as part of this, the tool was just run once manually.\n\nI\u0027d like to understand why we can\u0027t be just taking these URI lists from the CSDL Redfish.Uris field.  Can you give a brief explanation of why that wasn\u0027t possible?  Or ideally links to where you attempted it?",
