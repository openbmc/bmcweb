      "message": "Sorry about that.  I\u0027m not cool with it as written (Patchset 11).  It effectively reverts https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/60727 and thus reintroduces the original aggregated $expand issue that was fixed by that patch.\n\nI tested Patchset 9 and I\u0027m good with that one.  It makes considerations for depth expanded so we won\u0027t get burned by assuming whether or not aggregated resources have been expanded.",
