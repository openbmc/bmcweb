      "message": "I recall handling trailing \"/\" with top level collections was a bit wonky.\n\nThis was likely trying to deal with a similar edge case when I expanded the search to support finding URIs like `/redfish/v1` which are uptree from top level collections.\n\nThe tests still pass w/o this section of code.  Either this patch removes the need for this patch or it was never actually needed in the first place.\n\nI\u0027ve removed it.",

That\u0027s kind of unavoidable though and not much of a concern.\n\nI checked through the CL that added the check and it\u0027s not mentioned in the comments https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/59969.\n\nI\u0027d need to do some further investigation to see if it was ever needed at some point.
