      "message": "I think this still has an issue.  There\u0027s two options here:\n1. If the chassis has no drives, omit the DriveCollection.  IN this case, a query to the DriveCollection for that Chassis should return 404.\n\n2. If the chassis has no drives, always include a link to a DriveCollection, and in the cases where it\u0027s not present, will return an empty collection.\n\nYou seem to have done done a hybrid, where Chassis returns a link only if the drives are present, but DriveCollection doesn\u0027t return 404.  That needs resolved still I think.",
