      "message": "we added this because whomever added passwordChangeRequired didn\u0027t follow the pattern we have in the rest of this file of having two methods, a method that returns a nlohmann object, and a method that operates on res, and calls the nlohmann version.  This means that when we need to add a message, we have options on how to do it, which in the past was important.\n\nThis commit just moves it to be the same pattern.  Could I have done this in a different patch?  Maybe, but considering the method is getting 100% rewritten as part of this patch, it seemed reasonable to just do it here.\n\n\nwith that said, if it\u0027s important to you that it\u0027s in a different patch, I can do that.",
