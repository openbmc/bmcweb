      "message": "We are currently assuming that all sensors will be available under Chassis/Sesnors including sensors present in PowerSubsystem/ThermalSubsystem.\n\nAbout the plans I cannot commit to anything, this change is almost 2 years old and there is few more in the queue. I hope that other changes will take less that this one, but I guess someone else will have to take care of them. Probably I will already leave openBmc project before any of this patches is merged.",
