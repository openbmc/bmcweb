      "message": "I\u0027m not really opposed to what you did, but this line was supposed to pull in all the header-only libraries (which I guess it didn\u0027t)?. When is pulling in an explicit library required?  Previously it was only when using a shared/static library, but you\u0027ve done this work (presumably not for no reason), so clearly that\u0027s not right.\n\nWhat I\u0027m a little confused about is that this isn\u0027t all the bmcweb boost dependencies, for example, we use boost::system;:error_code in places.\n\nAny idea what the rules are on when things should go in this list, and when they are covered by headers?",
