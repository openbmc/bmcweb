      "message": "Because this is a case where the string_view actually represents a mutable structure, not just a pass through.  It\u0027s used to communicate how many characters were processed.  string_view is arguably the wrong data structure for this transform, and std library stuff would normally just return a size_t for \"# of characters processed\" or an iterator of where it got to, but that\u0027s not what happened in this case.\n\nI can add it to my list to clean up.",
