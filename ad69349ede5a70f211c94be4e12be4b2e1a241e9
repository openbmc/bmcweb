      "message": "It is easier nice that is separates the call back logic from the function logic. But I see you point, if there are many call backs one is more likely to make a mistake when tracing.\n\nHowever, it does allow us to test the free function. If good unit test are written, I would think the slight decrease in readability would be worth the ability to unit test. \nLet me know what you think.",
