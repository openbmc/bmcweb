      "message": "Thanks for bringing it up...after investigation it turns out this code is correct, but your comment revealed that my previous refactoring had a bug in it (https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/55468/8/redfish-core/lib/log_services.hpp#384) resulting in a regression (created time 1000000 x larger than it should be). Is it okay to use this patchset as the fix, or should I create a separate patchset for specifically fixing the regression first?",
