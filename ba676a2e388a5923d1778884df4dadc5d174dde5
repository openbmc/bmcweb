Would you like this patchset, and the next one to merge, and then we can work on the last couple places that need fixed?  If so, that works for me, please let me know.",

I am not sure what you mean and can\u0027t find the exact info in history (it\u0027s quite huge now).\nAbout your proposition - it\u0027s something we can do, that is after we fix your recent code-reviews on next one. But there\u0027s also question about PUT method - I see that you reverted it, can you tell reason behind that?",
