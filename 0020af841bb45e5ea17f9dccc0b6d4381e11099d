      "message": "Looking at this, we\u0027d have to make the router aware of URL parsing, and json parsing to make this work.\n\nAs written it looks like if I register\n\n/redfish/v1/Chassis/\u003cstr\u003e\nand\n/redfish/v1/Chassis/Foo#bar\n\nthe router won\u0027t be able to differentiate, because the child node needs to be attached at one level.\n\n\nI suspect making a redfish specific OEM router is probably the way to go here.  That way we can have more control over the API?\n\nAlso, calling privileges on a fragment handler doesn\u0027t make a ton of sense.  The route should have the same privilege level as the root.",

      "message": "The current router design will not diff between /redfish/v1/Chassis/\u003cstr\u003e and /redfish/v1/Chassis/Foo right. \nWhat advantage we are going to get if we make redfish specific OEM router. If I understand this correctly we will have an additional router instance specific to OEM along side the current router. So http_connection level we will take a call to call different routers ?. Unless the current implementation breaks the main use cases we need may be we manager with the same router with fragments as children and its not specific to RF.  \n\nThere is no privileges check for fragment routing. Its only done for the main route handler with the existing flow and then after the response we call the fragment handlers.",
