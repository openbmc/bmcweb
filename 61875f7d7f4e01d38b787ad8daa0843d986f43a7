This will be useful when there are redundant BMC systems. \n\nProbably the spec is confusing. I found a thread https://redfishforum.com/thread/485/eventservice-disabled-behaviour-sse-subscriptions and have asked further clarification on the same. I will update the commit accordingly.\n\nBut, there is a change needed to stop sending out the events when the \"ServiceEnabled\" property is false. I will push a new commit for the same",

      "message": "Agree on the second point, we shouldnt be sending out events when the service is disabled, but that\u0027s not what this patch is doing.\n\n\nit\u0027s still not clear to me what\u0027s gained by disallowing creating push subscriptions when the service is disabled.  If this were SSE, I might see disallowing the connection, but that\u0027s not this patchset.\n\n\"I believe the \"ServiceEnabled\" property is to control whether the BMC is supporting the event services or not.\"\n\nCorrect, but supporting the service is orthogonal to the subscriptions list.  They are separate, although related resources.\n\n\nWhile I don\u0027t think this patch is incorrect in terms of the Redfish specification, I don\u0027t think what we did originally is incorrect either, and considering we\u0027re not actually shutting down the resources for EventService, there\u0027s no real reason to enforce this upon the user.",
