      "message": "I\u0027m not really understanding what the problem is here.\n\nNot all fans support the Functional interface.  Some errors are expected when trying to read that interface for systems that don\u0027t support fan health.\n\nAs written, we would now break those systems by setting the fan to critical if the health was unsupported.\n\n\nThis commit also misses that in the path there\u0027s already a 500 internal error handler, so it needs to comment as to why the client in question is ignoring the error code.  Given that error code, I wouldn\u0027t expect the client to parse any key from the response.",

      "message": "The health values in the enum are ok, warning and critical. If the fan is absent, the health value is defaulted to OK which would be incorrect/confusing. That was the original issue. \n\nPerhaps a better fix is to default the health status to critical and update it to OK in the getFanHealth?",
