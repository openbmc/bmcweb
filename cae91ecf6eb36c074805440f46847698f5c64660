      "message": "We have a very \"touchy\" redfish client on our systems that will fail any operation (like a concurrent code update or maintenance operation) if the manager interface, even for one GET, returns an internalError. We\u0027ve been burned a few times on a missing service causing a internalError and failing a customer path. This is def not a critical property, so I\u0027d lean towards no error here, but, if we get an error on a systemd d-bus call we\u0027ve probably got bigger issues.",
