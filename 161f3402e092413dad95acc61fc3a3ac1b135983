If you want, we can split the \"add the registry\" things into a separate commit, as it\u0027s relatively self contained, but it\u0027s up to you.",

Your patchset now includes generated files, but doesn\u0027t include the generator.  We\u0027ll need to have a discussion on whether or not we want to generate the files, or just leave them as-is and edit them by hand.  For the base registry, we edit by hand even though they were generated, but we\u0027ll have to discuss what makes sense here.",
