Sounds like a bug with Redfish.\n\n```\n                \"Severity\": {\n                    \"deprecated\": \"This property has been deprecated in favor of MessageSeverity, which ties the values to the enumerations defined for the Health property within Status.\",\n                    \"description\": \"The severity of the message.\",\n                    \"longDescription\": \"This property shall contain the severity of the condition resulting in the message, as defined in the \u0027Status\u0027 clause of the Redfish Specification.  Services can replace the severity defined in the message registry with a value more applicable to the implementation in message payloads and event payloads.\",\n                    \"readonly\": true,\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"versionDeprecated\": \"v1_4_0\"\n                },\n```\n\nI wonder if the validator just ignores the required ?",

I would like this patchset to be focused on the change in the internal data structures to deduplicate stuff, with no user impact.  I\u0027d like to separate out the \"user impact\" portion into its own patch so that it can stay in review a little longer if people are actually using that field, and we can make sure we have a better commit message to point to.  It also gives them a clean way to revert the patch if they were using the deprecated field.\n\nPatch coming shortly.",
