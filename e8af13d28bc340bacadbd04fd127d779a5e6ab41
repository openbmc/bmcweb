None of them should have any effect if run twice.\n\nWhether or not to return a failure.   I\u0027m not really of the opinion that a removal can ever really fail, so my personal preference would be for this to return void, but I\u0027m just as ok with what was done in this patch, because it\u0027s still correct as written.",
