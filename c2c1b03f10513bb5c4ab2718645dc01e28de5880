Or do you think we should not require these things?\n\n\u003e Developers working on bmcweb/OpenBMC should have at least an understanding of Open Source Development.. \n\nHow do we ensure that?  And how do we handle the folks that have been taught the understanding, but continue to ignore it regularly?\n\n\u003e I also don\u0027t love this would be special to the bmcwbe repo\n\nBasically everything is specific to bmcweb.  Would any of these apply across the project?",
