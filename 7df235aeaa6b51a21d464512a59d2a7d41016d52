      "message": "George, we have a communication problem here.  Closing out comments with one word \"Updated\" is perfectly acceptable when you\u0027re being asked for a trivial change and you made the change, but in a lot of these cases you haven\u0027t actually made the change asked for, nor did you answer the question asked, so it\u0027s unclear what you think should happen next when you answer with one word replies.\n\nI see Janet has taken over, and seems to be answering the comments with more than one word answers, maybe we can try that, but reviewing this code over and over again and being ignored isn\u0027t going to work.",
