      "message": "We model boards as Assemblies.. Upstream there was discussion about help in PDI to know if the board should be modeled as an assembly or a chassis.. But I think the first step would be getting Assemblies in\n\nThis is also slightly different than the \"single chassis\" because we have multiple chassis, just not boards as chassis.\n\nAlthough I could be moved by an argument of \"this helps downstream forks carry patches\", I am more moved by the fact this information is repeated 10+ times. This is a best practices commit IMO.",
