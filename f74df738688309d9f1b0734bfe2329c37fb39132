That\u0027s not really a correct mapping, as AssetTag should map to the AssetTag propery.\n\nWhat I suspect you want to do is something similar to how the system UUID is implemented:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/3b28fa2b201513be89807dfb76b47b3ca7ee3f9b/include/persistent_data.hpp#L226\n\nBecause the ServiceIdentifier only applies to Redfish, it\u0027s easy to just keep in the bmcweb context, and store with the other \"service\" properties that are already kept.",
