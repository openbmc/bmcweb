      "message": "The two cases are:\nGetting per-entity configurations, for which any other daemon exposing it would be nonsensical, so we can go direct to EM in that case.\n\nChanging the per-entity configurations for PID control, which, ideally phosphor-pid-control would do like we do with sensors, and have a dbus API for all the pid parameters and loops, that would then \"write through\" to EM like dbus-sensors does for thresholds.  If we did it the \"right\" way, yeah, we\u0027d go to the mapper, but not a lot of effort has been put in these APIs since James wrote them.  I\u0027m not sure they\u0027re used anymore.",
