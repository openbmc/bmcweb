      "message": "So Redfish has a major, minor, and Errata.\nThis is for the protocol version but the schemas (data model) follow basically the same rule: \n\nMajorVersion.MinorVersion.Errata\n\nwhere\n\n    MajorVersion \u003d integer: something in the class changed in a backward incompatible way.\n    MinorVersion \u003d integer: a minor update. New functionality may have been added but nothing removed. Compatibility will be preserved with previous minorversions.\n    Errata \u003d integer: something in the prior version was broken and needed to be fixed.\n\n6.2. Protocol version\nhttp://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/DSP0266_1.5.0.html\n\nSo this 1_0_13 probably has some wording change.\nLooking at it, it looks like it updated the definition of AccountService.",
