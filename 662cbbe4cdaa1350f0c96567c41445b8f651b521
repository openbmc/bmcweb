      "message": "A client would do the GET operation on `LocationIndicatorActive` property to know the current state of the said LED group status.\n\nTo locate or identify a CPU, client would do PATCH operation on `LocationIndicatorActive` property. When this is done, bmcweb looks at the associated LED Group D-Bus object which is pointed to by `identify_led_group` association of the Inventory D-Bus object and then sets the Asserted property of the LED Group D-Bus object.\n\nIf the PATCH value is [true], the Asserted property of LED Group D-Bus object is set to [true]. If not, it\u0027s set to [false]\n\nLED GroupManager would then do what is needed as a response to getting the group Asserted property set. It can be turning [on] one or more LEDs or turning them [off].",
