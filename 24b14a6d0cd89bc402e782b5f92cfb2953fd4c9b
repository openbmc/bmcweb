      "message": "Ed and zhanghaicheng, thermal metrics allow us to collect all thermal sensors from the requested chassis and the sub-chassis under the requested chassis. This can be achieved to collect all sub-chassis using association say \u0027all_chassis\u0027 from requested chassis to sub chassis if exists and then collect the list of all sensors using association `all_sensors` from the chassis collection. Let us know if it can be added to this commit or I can push a commit on top of this commit.",

      "message": "Ed and zhanghaicheng, there is a performance issue with this call. As tested on AST2600 it can take upto ~70ms. Looks like this call identifies the ObjectMapper is implemented on a root or sensor path on the connections. It can be cut down using approach -\u003e first try to use the sensor path to get GetManagedObjects for the connection if there is a failure then fallback to default root path for the connection. In that case we can get rid of this call.",
