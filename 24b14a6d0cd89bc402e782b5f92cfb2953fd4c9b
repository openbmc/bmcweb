Looks like this call identifies the ObjectMapper is implemented on a root or sensor path on the connections. It can be cut down using approach -\u003e first try to use the sensor path to get GetManagedObjects for the connection if there is a failure then fallback to default root path for the connection. In that case we can get rid of this call.",
