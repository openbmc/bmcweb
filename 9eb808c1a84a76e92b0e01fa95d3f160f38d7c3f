I find the new one more readable, just because you don\u0027t have to worry about the distinction between\nparseIpsProperties(..) \u003d\u003d true\nparseIpsProperties(..) !\u003d false\nparseIpsProperties(..) \u003d\u003d false\nparseIpsProperties(..) !\u003d true\n\nwhen you\u0027re reading, there\u0027s only 2 option to logic through instead of 4.  Quite possible my brain works differently than others though, and this is highly subjective.\n\nIMO, I think being consistent is the most important thing, which, from your other comment it sounds like you agree.",
