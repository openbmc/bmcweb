      "message": "As written, I\u0027m fairly confident this:\n\nA. Breaks existing systems who had a board as their first chassis.\nB. Doesn\u0027t actually fix the problem.\n\nIn the current code, Item.Board and Item.Chassis are both considered Redfish Chassis.  Under that definition, that code is correct, even if the selection of a \"main\" chassis is arbitrary (ie first).\n\nThe correct fix to this is we need to find a way to determine the primary chassis for a system.  This will likely need to be a new interface.",
