And how do you know system headers (std ones, linux ones, etc)?\n\n\u003e is there a way to condifure in some configuration file in bmcweb repository to not include some headers, because right now there are pragmas almost in every file.\n\npragma is the only way I am aware. Unfortunately these results are the best I can do. Given all the benefits of including headers correctly, do you still think we can\u0027t take this change?",
