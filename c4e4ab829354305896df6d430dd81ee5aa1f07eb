Roughly two years ago their thinking was \" for sensors that are not covered elsewhere in the model - meaning don\u0027t duplicate Power and Thermal\" and that is what OpenBMC implemented. \nToday, as described in the new thermalsubsystem and powersubsystem documents the sensor collection should contain all sensors that are associated with that chassis. \n\nFrom https://redfishforum.com/thread/190/sensorcollection-contain-all-sensors-chassis\n\n\"we want everything that counts as a \"sensor\" to be part of the Sensor collection so that generic monitoring software can be built to harvest sensor data across the Redfish model\". \"",
