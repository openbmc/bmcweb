      "message": "I\u0027m wondering why `subscription.cpp` needs to be created?\nCan this class body implementation be done as a part of `subscription.hpp`?\n\nBy doing this way, it may loose the benefit of inlining functions.\nFor example, previously `matchSseId()` was inlined when it is referenced from `event_service_manager.hpp`. Now, since it is moved to `subscription.cpp`, it seems not inlined anymore.\nIn fact, I think most of functions of `Subscription` class becomes non-inlined with this.",
