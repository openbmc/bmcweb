In looking at this function, it doesn\u0027t look like it takes ownership of the response, so that part should be passed by crow::Response\u0026  The json object also has lifetime issues as you\u0027ve written it.",

I would\u0027ve expected your testing with the redfish service validator that you stated in your commit message to catch this;  Can you please triage why your testing didn\u0027t catch this, and get a bug filed with the service validator github for whatever the issue is?",
