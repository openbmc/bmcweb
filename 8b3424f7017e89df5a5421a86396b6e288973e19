      "message": "Can we talk here a little bit about the fact that this duplicates values, and how we would expect clients to deal with it in the commit message?  That seems important.\n\nAlso, I seem to recall that the new schemas have a links strategy for chassis to point at their various sensors.  Can we talk to why we didn\u0027t do that here?",

      "message": "Quote the idea of @Gunnar:\n\n```\nRedfish\u0027s reply was \"My statement from 18 months ago is no longer our \nrecommendation. That was before we proposed to re-factor the Power and \nThermal schemas to use the Sensor model. And that continues to be our \ndirection. So in that light, we want everything that counts as a \n\"sensor\" to be part of the Sensor collection so that generic monitoring \nsoftware can be built to harvest sensor data across the Redfish model.\n\nEven if an implementation hasn\u0027t decided to adopt the (still a \nwork-in-progress) PowerSubystem and ThermalSubsystem models, the \nunderlying temperature and fan sensors can be rendered as Redfish Sensor \nresources as a good middle ground (and a step in the right direction for \nfuture work).\".\n\nBased on that reply, I propose we move Redfish SensorCollection to show \nall sensors. Let me know if anyone objects.\n\nOpenBMC plans to support both the new and old Power/Thermal Schemas for some time. There does not appear to be a \"new\" sensor collection.\n```",
