I haven\u0027t seen anyone actually try to generate doxygen documentation, nor have I seen someone care to maintain it, so IMO, we should add comments where things are non-obvious, but not necessarily follow the rigid doxygen standard if it doesn\u0027t benefit us.\n\nNow, if bmcweb were something intended to be used as an a library API (which, it might in the future) then I think doxygen is a lot more valuable on the public interfaces.\n\nRant over.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e But I just added.
