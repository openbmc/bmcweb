It would likely look very similar to how LogEntry OEM is enabled, with a com.facebook OEM schema added to be able to enable this mode.\n\nThe existing standard didn\u0027t account for OEM-specified parsing mechanisms.",

      "message": "Hi Ed, thank you for working on this on such short notice. Discussing with mikechoi@meta.com, we decided to prioritise support for UPNs in our certs so we won\u0027t need this option (our TLS certs should have new UPN by the end of the year and I plan to develop/validate support for it soon).\n\nUntil then, specific internal tooling will be developed to support vendor BMC platforms that don\u0027t have the meta certificate parsing flag (e.g. using password auth).",
