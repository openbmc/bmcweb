You\u0027ve done a number of things that we\u0027ve found to be anti patterns, the most important of which is creating very long lambdas by taking existing code and wrapping it in a lambda.  Rather than that, generally we would recommend taking the code in question and putting it in a normal method.\n\nIt looks like you don\u0027t have a CLA set up, so take a look at the docs folder on how to set that up.",
