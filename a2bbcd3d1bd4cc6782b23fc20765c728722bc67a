The two agreements I found in the discussion, are #1 the agreement on how to handle the legacy systemName \"system\" for the time being and #2 the way on how to gradually implement multi host, which you have clarified very well. Is there another agreement I have missed?",

Some of this is documented in DBUS_USAGE.md  Collections are generally built by walking objects of the correct type, then parsing the leaf node, and using that within the URI.

I will change this, so the intended design is met. \nHowever, the current implementation is not using the getCollectionMembers method, instead we are hardcoding the member URI \"/redfish/v1/Systems/system\". If I would  use getCollectionMembers, currently the only reliable way to get multiple hosts is via the xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host interface, which for single host would return the leaf node \"host0\". This in turn, would end up naming the member URI on single host \"/redfish/v1/Systems/host0\". Should I consider this breaking the single host implementation?",
