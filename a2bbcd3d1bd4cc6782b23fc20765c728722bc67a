The two agreements I found in the discussion, are #1 the agreement on how to handle the legacy systemName \"system\" for the time being and #2 the way on how to gradually implement multi host, which you have clarified very well. Is there another agreement I have missed?",

      "message": "Please read and understand the existing way we handle multiple items in a collection.  Some of this is documented in DBUS_USAGE.md  Collections are generally built by walking objects of the correct type, then parsing the leaf node, and using that within the URI.  This is such a common pattern that we have the getCollectionMembers method specifically for this purpose.\n\nDoing this gives users the ability to set their own URI strings to within the limits of redfish, without bmcweb having to take an opinion on naming.  This is an important design consideration that needs added.",

      "message": "I understand, I made the wrong assumption here. I will change this, so the intended design is met. \nHowever, the current implementation is not using the getCollectionMembers method, instead we are hardcoding the member URI \"/redfish/v1/Systems/system\". If I would  use getCollectionMembers, currently the only reliable way to get multiple hosts is via the xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host interface, which for single host would return the leaf node \"host0\". This in turn, would end up naming the member URI on single host \"/redfish/v1/Systems/host0\". Should I consider this breaking the single host implementation?",

You\u0027ve done a number of things that we\u0027ve found to be anti patterns, the most important of which is creating very long lambdas by taking existing code and wrapping it in a lambda.

I will take care of it! \n\nAs for the CLA, I had trouble adding my company mail address to my gerrit account, which probably will resolve the issue. Who can I contact to help me with my account settings? It probably is due to the fact that I changed my github handle a few months ago, however my old handle is still occupying the mail address in gerrit, thus blocking my new handle to use that mail address.",
