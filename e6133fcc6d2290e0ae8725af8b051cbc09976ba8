      "message": "In the current code: sensorPath variable is set to \"/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors\" on line 118. Can we change this variable to directly ask object mapper to look for the path \"/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/power/total_power\" which we basically start doing at line146.\n\nIf we switch to \"/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/power/total_power\", we can save have to iterate through all the sensors on the system search for total_power. \n\n\nAlternatively,\nIf we want to keep this, can we remove the hard coding of \"/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/power/total_power\"? \nI\u0027m not a fan of this alternative but seems like we should pick one way or the other here.",
