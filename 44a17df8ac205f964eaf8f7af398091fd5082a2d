      "message": "The big issue I take with this is that you\u0027ve said \"instead\" of the primary portion.  We should _always_ be showing the primary portion.\n\nA better name for the secondary portion probably would have been \"extended\".  The purpose of it is for systems like the SBMR that use more than can fit in an 8 byte field; the remainder go into the array.  The hope was that vendors would still use the first 8 bytes as having the most useful information so that, if necessary, people could easily code reactions to the first 8 bytes.  [As an example, AMD processors require looking for specific post codes as failure indications which can only be reported by their hardware and not through BIOS SELs.]\n\nIf you\u0027re leaving the primary post code as 0s, this is a wrong implementation.",

IBM, if I recall, uses something like 32 _byte_ post codes, but the most informative are in the first 64 bits.\n\nI agree this should not be a configuration flag.\n\nThe \"setfill(\u00270\u0027)\" in the original code is, in my opinion, wrong for everything except for original 8 bit Intel post codes.  We probably should start with fixing that (so that only 8 bit post codes have a prefixed 0).  Once we do that, emitting the whole post code as one is probably the right thing to do.\n\nAs I mentioned in the commit message review, we probably should have called it \"Extended\" rather than \"Secondary\".\n\nI checked with what IBM was doing downstream, since they\u0027re the ones who originally requested the \"Secondary\" field, but I don\u0027t think it is too helpful for this discussion.  They\u0027ve come up with their own MessageRegistry entry (violating the use of \"OpenBMC\" but...) and add the whole post code as a new message argument.  https://github.com/ibm-openbmc/bmcweb/blame/1110/redfish-core/lib/log_services.hpp#L5253",
