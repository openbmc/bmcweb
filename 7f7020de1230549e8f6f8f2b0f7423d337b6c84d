Do we really want “IBM” here?  If so, should this be OEM code of some sort?  I’m not sure if it is good to add additional “only compiles on one machine that isn’t CI” code if we can help it.",

In most cases we want CI to cover the maximum code it can so we enable all options and then disable them as necessary in the bitbake recipe(s).",
