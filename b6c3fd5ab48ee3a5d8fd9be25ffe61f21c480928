Is there any case where we don\u0027t want to use the mapping if it exists?\n\nI\u0027d expect dbusEventLogEntryToEventLogObjectsType (wow that is a long function name) to handle cases where the dbus event id doesn\u0027t exist in the registry and then return the message/resolution/severity unchanged.\n\nCan we go that route rather than adding a new option?",
