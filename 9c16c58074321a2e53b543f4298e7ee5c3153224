      "message": "This doesn\u0027t track for me.  There isn\u0027t a single LocationIndicator instance, as this statement seems to imply, there is one per component.   They provide direct access to the LEDs, and a simple looping over all indicator properties on all resources, and turning them all on from the client seems like a much better fit for the redfish API way of doing things, as it would also allow the client to verify that all components where the LEDs are expected exist.  The only thing that\u0027s missing then is the timeout, but that seems relatively easy to implement with Job service, as a stand alone item that would be started before the routine was done.  Unless I\u0027m mistaken, that seems to fit well within the non-OEM redfish schemas.\n\nCan you add more details about why the existing redfish APIs wont\u0027 work as I\u0027ve described?",

      "message": "Lamp_Test is a IBM only requirement at this moment. The expectation is that the client calls \"Do The Lamp test\" and the BMC implementation will do what it means. Currently, what it means is that we :\n- Light up all the Indicator LEDs that are on the enclosure\n- Also, light-up some of the Green Power LEDs that have the software control\n- Send a command over to the LCD display daemon to exercise LCD\n- Send a PLDM command over to the Host so that Host can light-up the LEDs for all the external attached drawers.\n\n- Wait for configured time\n- Revert to old states\n\nWe can not offload this onto redfish clients and do LocationIndicatorActive one by one since we would then spread the logic into different redfish clients. Also, we can not achieve the above 4 functionalities if we offloaded that onto clients. This becomes challenging when we have more than 1 redfish clients.",
