      "message": "I’m not sure I understand the question.  yes, in theory we could use the generic GetAll handler for the expand queries, but given your recent optimizations, I think they will result in more dbus calls, so I left the existing code.  In theory we could test if those performance increases are still needed, but I think it’d be better to push that to a later patch, given that this patch works fine and is an improvement for the non expand case.",

So later I used GetManagedObjects for both case.\n\nNow in this patch, you are changing sensor to the previous option.\n\nThis is inconsistent. So I was asking for an explanation: what\u0027s the right direction and why is that?",
