      "message": "I just answered a bunch of things.  Some recommendations going forward:\n\n1. Read the documented rules.   Multiple versions of this patchset has broken so many of the documented rules that it makes it much harder to review.\n2. If the rules are confusing, ask specific questions on discord if you need a quick response to things.\n3. ACK means \"I understand and am working on it\".  \"Done\" means \"I\u0027ve made the change asked for\".  Being somewhat consistent in these responses helps maintainers to not spend an abnormal amount of time reviewing this.\n\nPlease help to review other users code in bmcweb to ensure that everyones patches get done faster.",
