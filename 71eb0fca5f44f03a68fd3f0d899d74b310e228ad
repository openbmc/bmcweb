Bmcweb EventService will have those newly added entries and SNMP service will not. Who will take care of sync between them in either case( Note you need handle both cases - Only SNMP service restart and only bmcweb service restart  and both of them restarts)",

Since SNMP protocol follow different code flow completely, Its good to have it separate file.
