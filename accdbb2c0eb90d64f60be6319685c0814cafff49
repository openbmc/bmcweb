      "message": "This change seems fine with me.  The if statement doesn\u0027t make sense to me.  sensorNames is the set of requested sensors within the current chassis.  So it would be normal I think for the output from GetManagedObjects to contain additional paths.  I don\u0027t know why this was logged.\n\nThis file has been through many changes by many different people, so I wonder if the purpose of some of the parameters changed over time and this if statement was not updated properly.",
