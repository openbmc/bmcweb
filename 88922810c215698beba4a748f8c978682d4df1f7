      "message": "Please call out what changes you would expect to see to the redfish tree in your commit message.  Do we now no longer have the ability to list more than 1 vlan?  It isn\u0027t clear to me from the code or the commit message.  Also, please call out if you expect any user facing impacts here.  Admittedly, vlan is a pretty low-use feature, (and was clearly broken for a while, so it\u0027s likely nobody is using it) so I\u0027m not that worried about compatibility here, but I would like to understand potential impacts.",

      "message": "In fact, nothing will be changed on the Redfish side. It still has the ability to list VLAN multiple VLAN interfaces.\n\nAs I said in the commit message, OpenBMC uses a virtual interface to represent a VLAN, as well as Redfish. Both VLAN and physical interface are interfaces that can have at most 1 VLAN ID assigned.\n\nThe ability to associate VLAN interface with physical interface always uses the interface name, no matter before or after this patch. On Dbus, interfaces are also listed in a \"plain\" way like\n/\u003cservice\u003e/eth0\n/\u003cservice\u003e/eth0_100\n/\u003cservice\u003e/eth0_200\n/\u003cservice\u003e/eth1\nThe format is \u003cparentInterfaceName\u003e_\u003cvlanId\u003e\n\nI updated commit message to point out it has no impact on the redfish response. It\u0027s just a code optimization.",
