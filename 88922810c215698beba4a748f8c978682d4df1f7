It isn\u0027t clear to me from the code or the commit message.  Also, please call out if you expect any user facing impacts here.  Admittedly, vlan is a pretty low-use feature, (and was clearly broken for a while, so it\u0027s likely nobody is using it) so I\u0027m not that worried about compatibility here, but I would like to understand potential impacts.",
