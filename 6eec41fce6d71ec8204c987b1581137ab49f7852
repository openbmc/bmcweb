      "message": "more detail here, including a link to the OWASP standards you\u0027re citing.  We do validate the content type by actually parsing it, so I suspect we meet the intent of the OWASP guidelines.  There\u0027s lots of places where we can implicitly assume a content-type.\n\nOverall, there\u0027s lots of places where we implicitly assume a content-type given the URI, as the specification is defined that way (redfish for example only defines JSON).\n\n\nSuddenly checking this while technically correct, has the potential to break a lot of scripts that were previously working.  I\u0027m open to this being a security issue, but it\u0027s not clear what that would be, as the content-type is controlled by the user, so it doesn\u0027t really change the security boundary by checking possibly-attacker sent fields.\n\nThe patchset itself has some style things that need fixed as well, but lets get the \"why\" sorted out first, then we can deal with the actual implementation.",
