However, even with this resolved, the new mechanism doesn\u0027t seem to work as intended, as immediately after deferring the read, websocket object gets destroyed, which leads to bmcweb crash. \nI\u0027m figuring out what could be the cause of that, maybe it\u0027s something trivial that we both had missed.",

      "message": "Michal, please take a look and let me know if this solves the buffering problem.  Basically, this method allows avoiding reading the socket until a time at which it can be buffered, so we avoid the crash.  This seems better than an arbitrary delay, which might cause problems if we have buffering issues.",
