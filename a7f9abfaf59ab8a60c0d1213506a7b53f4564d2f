      "message": "Just setting expectations, it\u0027s going to be a looooooong time before I even talk about entertaining any \"new\" health rollup system.  Nobody cared about this one and multiple calls to get people to own health rollup as a whole went completely unanswered.  If I see a new design doc shortly after this gets removed, under the premise that \"the code is now deleted, so therefore it functionally never existed\", it will put me in a mood that the submitter isn\u0027t going to like.\n\nAs a feature, health rollup is non trivial to get correct, and even when you do, it\u0027s very likely to cause a performance problem.  I don\u0027t know of ANY bmc stack that implements it consistently to any other stack.  That would kind of imply that it\u0027s OEM-specific by definition.\n\nI suspect that Redfish needs to publish better guidance on how health rollup needs to work functionally, and very likely bmcweb needs to find a solution to the performance problems with calling lots of DBus objects, both of which which are going to be a non trivial amount of work) before we can entertain anything net new.",
