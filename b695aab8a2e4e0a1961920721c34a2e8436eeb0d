      "message": "not blocking, but why check the URI option instead of the multi-host option?\n\nDo you want to replace the multi-host option and instead branch on an empty RF system URI name instead?\n\nI mean it makes sense, an empty system URI name could indicate a multi-host system.\nOne less option to worry about.\n\nBut i am still confused since the branches in your other patches look different, where you mostly branch on the multi-host option.\n\nMaybe this would be easier if we passed an `std::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e` for the system name instead of having two symbols used throughout the code.\n\nThen there would only be one thing to branch on and clang-tidy could help check that any code path accessing the RF system name should have a check beforehand.",
