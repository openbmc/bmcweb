      "message": "It seems odd that this parameter is now required on log entry?  What about for systems that don\u0027t support notifying the service provider?  Adding this property unconditionally in redfish implies that support, even for systems that don\u0027t have that capability.  I suspect some level of dbus interface changes will need to happen to either make this optional, or to convey whether or not this is supported on the given system.",
