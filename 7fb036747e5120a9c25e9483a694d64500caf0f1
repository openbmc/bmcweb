The only other thing we could do is keep a list somewhere of explicit versions of the schema, but then we\u0027re back to people forgetting to update them.  I think DMTFs guidance is coming from a place of \"less change is better\", but if the change is automated, I\u0027m not sure it hurts us.\n\nAnywho, it sounds like you\u0027re ok with it.  I\u0027m open to criticism of this, \"null hypothesis\" (ie leave it like it is), or other ideas that might be better.",
