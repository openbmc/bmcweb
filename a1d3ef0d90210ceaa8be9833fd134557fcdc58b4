Can you speak to why that wasn\u0027t usable in this case?  We already have quite a bit of infrastructure, including the signal listener, for handling that, and it gives clients a better way to wait for their operation to complete, so unless there\u0027s a good reason to avoid it in this case, I\u0027d really like to reuse what we have.",
