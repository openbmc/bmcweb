URIs are opaque by definition in the spec, so whether we use a hash, an id, an index, or a human-readable string, is at the discretion of bmcweb.\n3. There are LOTS of other places where we hardcode URI ids in non system-specific ways.\n4. The mockups are an _example_.  They can not and do not convey all requirements in the spec, so if someone is trying to make the argument that we don\u0027t follow the specification, they need to use wording in the specification to do it, not that we don\u0027t follow the mockups.  There\u0027s almost no case where we follow the mockups 100%.\n5. At such time as someone is willing to put forward the significant effort to make the names configurable per system, we can hardcode the existing systems to what they are today (ie system and system\u003cn\u003e), so I don\u0027t see this patch being a significant impediment to making URIs configurable in the future.",
