      "message": "2 GET requests is definitely not enough to test that multi-factor authentication has been implemented to the Redfish specification.  Is there a set of scripts/tests somewhere where you\u0027ve verified this functions as intended?\n\nThis is changing a security boundary.  The testing should be much much more extensive when making those kinds of changes, including verifying each of the 5 login types works as designed when MFA is enabled.  For example, I see no changes to mTLS auth or Basic auth that would imply that MFA is now being enforced on those.  It\u0027s very likely that those two auth types need to be disabled if MFA is enabled, but I don\u0027t see that implemented.",

Many patches no longer apply, and it isn\u0027t clear to me if patches like:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/74938\n\nAre related and expected in this series or not.  I would ideally like to see some cross review as the relevant people are building this feature.",
