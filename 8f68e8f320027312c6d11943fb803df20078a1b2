In 24 I just cleaned up the commented code that was present in 22 to make it more readable.  All of the commented code was just my previous attempts at getting a working solution.\n\nThe two approaches are how the handler argument is handled in the capture inside getSatelliteConfigs() from redfish_aggregator.hpp.  The approaches are essentially:\n\n1) [handler{handler}]\n2) [handler{std::move(handler)}]\n\nThe code is currently configured for the second option.",
