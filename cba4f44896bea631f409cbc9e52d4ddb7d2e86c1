      "message": "This code block was removed and not replaced.  Please mention this in the commit message.\n- Before this change, a local user\u0027s expired-password state would be refreshed for every HTTP operation.  For example, if the user\u0027s password expired during a session, the very next operation using that session would likely fail due to lack of privileges (because a user with an expired password effectively has only the ConfigureSelf privilege).\n- With this change, a local user\u0027s expired password state is established at the start of the session and cannot be changed.\n- This means a user who changes their expired password would have to login again to regain their role\u0027s privileges.\n- This also means a user whose password expires during a session will be able to continue using that session with full privileges until they log out.",
