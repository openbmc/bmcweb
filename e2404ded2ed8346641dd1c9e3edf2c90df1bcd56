I did learn some of this by talking to the maintainer on slack and reading a bit of the code.\n\nI really wish James had gone a different path for this stuff way back when.  The assumption that boost::url was going to be included in boost in short order turned out to be incorrect, although in talking to the maintainer, it sounds like the review is coming soon and they\u0027re rounding out the library.",
