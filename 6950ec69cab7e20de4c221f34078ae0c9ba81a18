      "message": "Ok, this is much better, but lets use std::isfinite, to ensure that the value is actually representable.  There\u0027s lots of weird nonsensical stuff that doubles can contain.  For example, a cable of length negative infinity would be weird to see.\n\nIn a perfect world, we\u0027d do something like\n\nif (!isfinite){\n    if isnan{\n        return;\n    }\n    set internal error\n    return\n}\n\nso that the user could know that the dbus interface contract was broken.  With that said, I\u0027m ok with just isfinite if you don\u0027t want to do the above.",
