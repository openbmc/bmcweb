      "message": "We need to have a little discussion about separation of concerns here.  Right now we\u0027re just packing everything into the HttpClient class, which doesn\u0027t seem appropriate, and is making this patchset really hard to review.\n\nIMO (and yes, this is opinion, I\u0027m happy to have my mind changed) we need:\n\n1. A class for the generalized idea of an \"Http request sender\" that encapsulates a generic HTTP layer.\n2. A class for EventService, that has class #1 as a member variable\n3. A class for aggregation, that has class #1 as a member variable.\n\n\nDoes that seem reasonable in terms of how to break this problem down?",
