      "message": "Yes, for a single connection connectFailed is an intermediate state - waitAndRetry() is called which either retries (if retryCount \u003c maxRetryAttempts) or transitions to terminated state.\n\nHowever, from my testing on the platform, I observed that typically only one connection in the pool transitions to terminated, while the remaining connections stay in connectFailed state indefinitely. They never transition to terminated.\n\nAs I understand it (please correct me if I\u0027m wrong), having one connection reach terminated state should be sufficient condition to delete the subscription with TerminateAfterRetries policy. The bad_gateway response already indicates that max retry attempts were exhausted for that event delivery.",
