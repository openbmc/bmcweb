Why would an int array of size 1 help us here.  We need an int array of size 2?  Also note, this wasn\u0027t a compilation error with gcc, but tidy.  You\u0027re right, gcc will compile this code just fine.\n\n\u003e; That means array declaration doesn\u0027t make any difference for compilation. So std::array will be a simpler replacement, and if it removes the clang warning the code looks neater.\n\nPlease just run the full suite of CI tests on it, and tell me what you tested.  When I tested all the variations, I wasn\u0027t able to get std::array to both call correctly into pipe() AND pass clang/gcc/tidy warnings.  If you have something that does, please let me know what it is, but I had previously tried all the variations you suggested.\n\nIdeally just stack a patch on top of this one;  If it passes CI, I can just squash it in.",
