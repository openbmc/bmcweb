      "message": "Some quick back of the napkin math.  There are 40 calls to GetAll in bmcweb.  This commit ports 2 of them to the new pattern, and adds 1kB while doing it.  Assuming that pattern holds, moving all of them would result in a 20KB increase in bmcweb size, or about a 2% increase in the total size.  We need to decide if that\u0027s worth it, or if we expect the scaling to net us some wins as we roll this out other places.",
