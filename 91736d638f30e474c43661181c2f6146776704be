      "message": "Would it be good form to use AdditionalData to store the OemRecordFormat instead of having a whole other field for it?\n\nThis is just my naive observation as a non-BMC contributor. I\u0027m seeing that OemRecordFormat and EntryType break down the generic modelling of the record in Logging/Entry according to the discussion of https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/43831/. \n\nWhatever instance wants to produce an OEM log that they know will be consumed by bmcweb could populate AdditionalData[\"OemRecordFormat\"] and have that value be propagated. How does AdditionalData get used elsewhere in the codebase?",
