It seems odd we would have these in OEM schemas.\n\nPlease also read and understand https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/OEM_SCHEMAS.md\n\nSo there are no surprises when this goes out for actual review.",

I will contact with Redfish forum and try to let the properties become the standard without OEM.\n\nThe OEM schema doc helps a lot when I implemented this feature. Hope we can define the data as the standard properties.",
