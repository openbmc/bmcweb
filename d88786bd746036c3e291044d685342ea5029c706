I suspect this same behavior can be accomplished in a 15 line diff.",

I wanted to restrict the usage of ifdef TASK_EVENT to one place, which is in webserver_main.cpp. \n\nWithout this patch I can see that it should be used in at-least in 3 files. \n1) messgae_registry.hpp\n2) server_root.hpp\n3) webserver_main.cpp\n\nThink about scenario where we have  sever such apps. These three files will be having several ifdef checks. \n\nMy want is that inclusion of application header file in wbserver_main.hpp is enough to enable everything about it",
