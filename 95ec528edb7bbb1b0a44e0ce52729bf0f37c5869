When I was working on unpackProperties for bool it didn\u0027t really matter but for more complicated types like, string, vector bmcweb binary was bigger.\n\nPersonally I prefer optionals, but if smaller binary size is priority we should use pointers like it was used before. To be consistent we should use pointer for all optional properties.",
