This moves to show both when you have AutomaticRetryConfig, regardless of the value, which I think makes sense. \n\nI guess this was here before.. If you don\u0027t have a AutomaticRetryConfig, don\u0027t show RemainingAutomaticRetryAttempts / AutomaticRetryAttempts I guess that is why these are chained?\n\nI am okay with this as is.",
