It\u0027s an optional property so I would agree with this change (and it was probably added based on the code review comments for 1177), but would have been best to put in a separate patch set and focus this one only on the new feature.",

This moves to show both when you have AutomaticRetryConfig, regardless of the value, which I think makes sense. \n\nI guess this was here before.. If you don\u0027t have a AutomaticRetryConfig, don\u0027t show RemainingAutomaticRetryAttempts / AutomaticRetryAttempts I guess that is why these are chained?\n\nI am okay with this as is.",
