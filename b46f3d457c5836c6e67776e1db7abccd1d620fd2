      "message": "I am in favor of this. I think the upside (not dealing with schema versions, no more failing the validator because the schema wasn\u0027t bumped, mismatching schema versions (e.g., Log Entry version A here and Log Entry version B there)) outweighs the negative (more work/chance at failing when moving to the new release pack, schemas becoming less independent, more churn in our schema versions). I would still prefer a list somewhere of explicit versions of the schemas we use, but I understand why you went this way (maintaining that list is going to be a pain, just like maintaining those individual schema versions today) also this has a few extra benefits - E.g. no more author failed to bump the schema.",
