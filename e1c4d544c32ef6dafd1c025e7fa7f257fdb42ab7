      "message": "yeah, I was very confused on what it is trying to do since it does not actually do anything. All request will create a new set of sensors.\n\nI\u0027ll add more details on what I think the issue is. Maybe it is not even an issue. I just thought it was wrong.\n\n----\n\nLooking at the sensor code again, it seems like that sensorsNames are meant to be used when Chassis requesting the sensor collections.\n\nSee \nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/e8204933be90353ef672e62dc628448173279e1c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L2943-L2948\n\nand \n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/e8204933be90353ef672e62dc628448173279e1c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L387-L397\n\nI was only looking at the request single sensor (I created a seperate copy of sensor.hpp and deleted all the non related code... because the file is to long) and missed the actual use case. In that case, this looks right. The sensor request code is just reusing the sensor collection but for one sensor.\n\nWill abandon this soon if there are no any concern.",
