      "message": "1. My change tries to find new privilege combinations in Subordinate map (first cycle at diff in parse_registries.py). Others don\u0027t.\n\n2. Different variables naming for aliases in privilege_registry.hpp for new subordinate privileges. I\u0027m not sure who named it better. I tried to describe all subordinate subsequence.\n\n3. My change has no usage of new privileges. Maybe I will push its usage later as another change.",

      "message": "Ok.... I\u0027ve got some awkward questions here.  Does anyone actually care about the privilege registry for non-admin users?  The only use cases I see most of the time are Admin and Read-Only.  Nobody has tried to sort out the whole problem where Operator Privilege has a lot more permissions than it should.\n\nI really do appreciate the work, but it would be good to know where you\u0027re wanting to go with this.",
