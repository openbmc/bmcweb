      "message": "1. My change tries to find new privilege combinations in Subordinate map (first cycle at diff in parse_registries.py). Others don\u0027t.\n\n2. Different variables naming for aliases in privilege_registry.hpp for new subordinate privileges. I\u0027m not sure who named it better. I tried to describe all subordinate subsequence.\n\n3. My change has no usage of new privileges. Maybe I will push its usage later as another change.",

      "message": "Ok.... I\u0027ve got some awkward questions here.  Does anyone actually care about the privilege registry for non-admin users?  The only use cases I see most of the time are Admin and Read-Only.  Nobody has tried to sort out the whole problem where Operator Privilege has a lot more permissions than it should.\n\nI really do appreciate the work, but it would be good to know where you\u0027re wanting to go with this.",

      "message": "Exactly. Operator has lot more permissions. \nI was solving a problem where the operator could change network settings. Operator should not be able to do this because of subordinate privileges according to dmtf privilege registry.\nAnd yes, I saw some discussions about operator role. Someone from dmtf wrote that they were thinking about eliminating this role at all. \nBut this doesn\u0027t solve a problem, when bmcweb ignores subordinate overrides for privileges.\nSo I created a change to parse subordinate overrides, but not to use it for now.",
