I cannot think of a reason to return those as json values where it would be the correct thing to do, and not have surprising encoding problems.  If the goal is to return a string/number/value directly, it can be directly written to the body(), because it\u0027s not really a \"json\" response at that point.\n\nIf there\u0027s a use case that requires this, I\u0027m happy to discuss, but given that this use case is currently only for downstream code, it\u0027s hard to hypothesize.",
