Has DMTF started publishing multiple language schemas.\n\nThe code looks fine, and makes sense (I don\u0027t remember why we hardcoded that in the first place) but knowing why you made the change would be helpful.",

      "message": "I\u0027m implementing AMI AttributeRegistry, and MegaRAC BIOS provides AttributeRegistry with \"en-US\" language. Probably it will work fine with default \"en\", but i decided to make language adjustable. Language from header is already being used here ( https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/70741/1/redfish-core/lib/message_registries.hpp#b214), so my change would make behaviour more consistent (if DMTF somewhy change language from \"en\" to something else, not all \"language\" fields would be affected with current implementation).",
