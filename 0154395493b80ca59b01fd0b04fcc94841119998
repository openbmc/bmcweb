As it stands, I don\u0027t fully understand how the existing solution works, so it\u0027s unlikely I\u0027d be able to review additions to the feature without breaking anyone.\n\nPlease work to find a health rollup expert and get them added as a reviewer, as well as to start reviewing existing health rollup code.",
