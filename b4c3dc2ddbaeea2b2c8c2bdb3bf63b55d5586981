A good default behavior is that we deny the access if the resource is not in the list. Is this implemented?\n\nAlso, how can we make sure this list is correct? I assume it is hand-written, right?\n Edward Lee:\nIt is handwritten, the plan is to deny any patches to that entry in the privilege registry if a newly added resource missed adding to that list. Making sure that the list is correct could be a script/test that tries to patch every resource. If it fails any one, then the list isnt correct.",
