I see that that compiler directive is missing(removed?) here. \n\nYes, there is.  This way, a majority of the code gets compiled in all cases, and it\u0027s less likely that we\u0027ll run into build errors.  This is how all the other optional modules have been done;  IBM_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE is not unique in this regard.\n\nThe root of the complexity here is that we\u0027ve designed something with cross dependencies, where internal data structures need to change dependent upon external options, rather than implementing a new schema.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e There is no need to add the compiler flag inside this file\n\nDisagree.  Doing it this way means that IBM code gets tested more often in CI, which I think is a good thing.",
