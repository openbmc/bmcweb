Considering that boost::urls::format works fine, wouldn\u0027t we be better off using it uniformly?\n\nIt\u0027s pretty rare we hit this pattern.  Generally we would not be putting a URL type into a piece of another URL (in fact, this is the only instance I know of).  Normally we\u0027d pass through the variable pieces, possibly in a struct, and reconstruct the string we wanted without using a URI as input.  Obviously that doesn\u0027t work in this case.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e I\u0027d be curious what\n\u003e \n\u003e My guess is it will try to coerce something after that first http:// into a hostname (properly encoded), and try to coerce everything after that into a path (again, properly encoded).  Why is this particular set of inputs interesting or relevant - all we ever do in bmcweb is encode paths isn\u0027t it?\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be nice if that were all we parsed :).  We do parse full URIs.\n\nFWIW, I really wish there were a fixed type for \"URI path\" so we could trust it, but I\u0027m not aware there is.\n\nIf this isn\u0027t a change you want to make, this is fine, I can go fix it.",
