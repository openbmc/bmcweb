Jason is CCed here.\n\nFWIW, I reviewed this code originally, and this is the way we wanted to do it, but we needed c++20 to get the non-const data() pointer.  I\u0027d be really surprised if this broke anything, but I don\u0027t have a crashdump enabled system to test on, and this seems cleaner than just commenting out the check for those lines.\n\nI can ping jason offline.",
