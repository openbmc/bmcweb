      "message": "Yeah, I think further discord discussion noted that because we have a bmcweb.socket, it will auto start whenever someone needs it so there\u0027s no real need to have it restart on fail.\n\nThe only reasons I can think that the restart is good:\n- Startup time, there is a non-0 time to get bmcweb up and running and respond\n- Errors, if bmcweb is broke, lets get it restarted it\u0027s max times (3 within 30 sec) and get the BMC into a Quiesce state indicating to our users that we have an issue (of course you need bmcweb to report that error out ...)\n- Events - Users can request events be generated (i.e. when a error is created, or a boot progress changes). bmcweb needs to be running to see these and generate the event. With satellite BMC\u0027s and event monitoring of them, this will becomes more critical.\n\nOnly that last one seems like a solid reason to me to do this restart.",
