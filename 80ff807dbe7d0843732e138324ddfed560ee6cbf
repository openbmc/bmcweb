      "message": "This is how I interpret your expected logic from the initial comment in context of the code I have pushed in patchset 5:\n\n\u003e I would expect some logic like:\n\n\u003e Build the collection\n\n-\u003e getCollectionMembers\n\n\u003e If there is only one member, have the collection name match  BMCWEB_REDFISH_SYSTEM_URI_NAME\n\n-\u003e extra step\n\nMy assumption was, this extra work might be needed, since getCollectionName might put a member id that does not match BMCWEB_REDFISH_SYSTEM_URI on single host, depending on how the system is configured in EM. At least that is what I read from the comment. I am sorry for the confusion, I will adjust accordingly.\n\n\u003e If we really need more code, just create a getSystemCollectionMembers that does \n\u003e the same thing, and at the end, have it call whatever you need.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is neccessary anymore.",
