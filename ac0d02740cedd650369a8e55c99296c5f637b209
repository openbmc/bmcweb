I didn\u0027t mean to overwrite your changes while you were still planning on working on it.\n\nFeel free to override whatever of mine you would like.\n\nWith that said, I would still like to see the message registry updates done in a different patch.  They are pretty isolated, and I suspect can merge significantly before anything else, but we need to understand the use cases for them.  Please make sure that\u0027s clear in the commit message.",
