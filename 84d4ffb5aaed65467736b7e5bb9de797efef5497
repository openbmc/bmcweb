If you have any questions about the coding standards or rules, please ask them on discord or the mailing list BEFORE sending your patch, to avoid rework.\n\nI stopped reviewing after 10 comments for things that are documented in the above.\n\n\nOverall, reading through he code, this seems like it\u0027s proposing a significant change to how we write Redfish to DBus conversion handlers.  I love the experimental nature of this work and want to foster its development, so if you need any help in understanding the code, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask.\n\nPlease keep in mind that as a general rule, bmcweb aims for consistency in implementation, so any wide-sweeping changes would ideally need to come with accompanying patches to make at least a significant portion of the codebase consistent with any new philosophy, or prove that the efficiency of having two mechanisms for doing conversions is worth the added complexity.  Please work that into your plans for this feature.",
