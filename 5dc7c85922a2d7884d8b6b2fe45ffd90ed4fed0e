General setup needs to happen under the RedfishSessionContext above, before the sleep.\nThe sleep is really just a hack around a bug.\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/78519/comment/59674fdb_f10fc164/\n\nAcknowledge",

Users coming up with their own upn seems error prone, and this test script should be as easy to run as possible.\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/78519/comment/54c2a24d_926499ed/\n\nI am not entirely sure about this because the domain part of the UPN need to match the device domain right? If we have bmc device `macbmc1r0019p0030-oob.02.cco2.facebook.com`, we should be able to use upn `malikrafsan@facebook.com` but not `malikrafsan@facebook.net` right?",

Defaults don\u0027t make any sense in that case. should we grab the hostname from redfish/v1/ManagerProvidingService -\u003e Manager -\u003e NetworkProtocol (HostName property)\n\nso we know exactly the hostname the system is expecting?  I think that would solve it and be less error prone for users, right?",
