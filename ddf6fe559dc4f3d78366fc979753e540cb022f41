We have been keeping all the same schemas the same version.\n\n54030 is a new direction. \n54030 has merge conflicts and hasn\u0027t been touched since Jan 23, 2023\nThis commit seems reasonable to me, 54030 can supersede it when/if it goes in. \n\nIf 54030 was close to going in I would be okay with waiting on 54030 and just abandoning this but looking at 54030 I don\u0027t see that",
