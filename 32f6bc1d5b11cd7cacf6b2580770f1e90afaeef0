Arguably at some point we should just scrub and find all the remaining crow:: things, and change them to bmcweb, but that would break a lot of forks, which I don\u0027t want to do.\n\n\u003e If that was there the switch between different options could be done in single place and will be customisable using some compiler directive as per need.\n\nFWIW, that\u0027s not something bmcweb has ever optimized for, because it would pull in a lot of extra headers into unrelated places.  Even though this was a change to many places, it was done with two sed replace commands (one for the definition and one for the include).",

If we had type alias in a single file then both contributer and reviewer job would have been easier. \n\nbmcweb is an application not a library.If worry is about the possibility of name collision ,that can be easily spotted and fixed in application. \n\nI still not convinced why bmcweb does not encourage type aliases for boost types. It is much easier to read, write and maintain IMO.",
