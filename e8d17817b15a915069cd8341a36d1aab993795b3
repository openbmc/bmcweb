      "message": "\"Updates to themeing need to happen in 2 repos now. \"\n\nTechnically this was already a problem, it\u0027s just that nobody cared to theme the redfish UI, given it\u0027s really engineering facing.  This just makes the problem more noticeable.\n\n\"It makes it tougher to support different GUIs, e.g. phosphor-webui\u0027s login screen is different than webui-vue \"\n\nMaintaining 2 webuis can\u0027t be the long term project direction, and realistically we can\u0027t be holding people to validating 2 separate webuis for every change made to the backend.  What\u0027s your plan for merging webui-vue with phosphor-webui?   Don\u0027t get me wrong, I fired up webui-vue a few weeks back, and I really like the direction you\u0027ve taken it in.  It\u0027s way cleaner (even if it is a litter bigger binary-size wise:) ) we just need to figure out a way to make it maintainable in that phosphor-webui and bmcweb had a lot of specific handshaking to make a lot of flows \"just work\".  I see a lot of that got copied into webui-vue, which is good, but patches moving forward can\u0027t have to consider 2 different UIs in all cases.\n\nMy kneejerk reaction was to put this behind a BMCWEB_INSECURE flag, so the webui-vue users can continue to use it in the less secure mode, until webui-vue makes the equivalent changes (note, webui-vue looks like is already doesn\u0027t handle mtls auth, so most these changes need made before a full cutover anyway).  With that said, I\u0027m open your your thoughts on it.  Should this wait until you and your team have come to full feature parity with phosphor-webui to not break anyone, or are we better off forcing a config option on users?  Given the hard fork, and the webuis required reliance on non-spec driven apis, I\u0027m sort of not sure what to do here.\n\n\"Thought on how we support things like password change needed?\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/29136\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/webui-vue/+/33955\"\n\nIn the same way we transfer the \"you\u0027re already logged in\" info to phosphor-webui, you can transfer the \"you need to change your password\" info for the ui to react to.  I\u0027d probably do it as a 301 to an appropriate \"Change your password\" route.  I can take a look at specific patches when I handle the first TODO below.",

In the very old pre phosphor-webui world, the (terrible) angular webui was checked into bmcweb directly, to avoid problems like this, and was selected with a config option.\n\nAlso, at some point, this will likely turn into a template, to pass hidden form information forward like most conventional forms setups do, and that will require bmcweb to have the template information in the repo.",
