      "message": "These changed. \nI have seen these in Redfish before with like elements in an array and I think this is where this came from but looking at the mockups from Redfish that still have the old Power/Thermal, Redfish does not seem to have odata.type for any elements in an array anymore. Just odata.id with that fragment (e.g.   \"@odata.id\": \"/redfish/v1/Chassis/1U/Power#/PowerControl/0\",) \nE.g. redfish » v1 » Chassis » 1U » Power in\nhttps://redfish.dmtf.org/redfish/mockups/v1/1206\n\nWonder if we should just remove?",
