      "message": "We should really get this codified better because what I seem to be hearing (subject to interpretation) in the working groups is that assembly is ok for \"dumb\" devices, but anything that needs modeled more significantly, or might have sub-nodes will need a Chassis.  Using the newest SmartNic proposal as an example, which in theory has the latest best practices accounted for, this would require a smartnic (which in OpenBMC would have a type \"Board\") to be a Chassis per the mockups (see \"Card1\" and \"Card2\"), so I suspect we can\u0027t just indiscriminately say \"all boards are assemblies\".  MAYBE (this needs more thought) we could say that boards without sensors or thermal nodes should be assemblies?  But that starts to get into a weird distinction that we should document very clearly and have a good long term plan for.",

For some reason I remember years ago DMTF having a discussion about assemblies, and how that was largely the future, but in the last year or so, they\u0027ve kind of taken a 180, and now all the new models are using Chassis again for non-trivial cards and devices.\n\n\u003e So a board of type smartnic is a chassis but some other \"dumb\" board is a assembly.\n\nMaybe we need a new board variation?  I\u0027m having a little trouble coming up with a definition other than \"dumb board\", or guidance on when to use each.  In theory, if the board had ANY sensor, firmware, or controllable system on it, it should be a chassis, otherwise, it\u0027s an assembly.  now the question is how to codify that.......\n\nmaybe some code in chassis that checks for the relevant associations to sensors/drives ect that would make the board \"smart\"?  That sounds sucky to code.",
