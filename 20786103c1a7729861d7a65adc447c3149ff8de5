It has PCIe ports as well as Network ports. See dbus-sensors patch - https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/83202 \n\n@ed@tanous.net suggested that such a device is not exactly a Fabric Adapter and the FabricAdapter URI cannot be used for such a device, and hence the Switch URI is used.",
