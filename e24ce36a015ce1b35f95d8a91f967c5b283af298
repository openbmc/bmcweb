      "message": "Have you considered setting reasonable limits, then using NOLINT calls for the functions that don\u0027t meet the criteria?  As-written, this is only going to enforce that the longest function (I\u0027m assuming the one in sensors.hpp) doesn\u0027t get longer, which doesn\u0027t really seem all that helpful.\n\nThat\u0027s how we\u0027ve handled these kinds of ratchets in the past.  Grep for NOLINT and you\u0027ll find several that we\u0027re still working through.",

      "message": "Do you have an intention personally fixing these over time through refactoring?  Or are you asking for help in doing this migration?\n\nI see this same patchset was sent to several clang-tidy enabled repos, all with different parameters keyed in.  It would be good to:\n\nA. Get a patchset out to the base clang-tidy in the docs repo with the desired settings for this, and how those desired settings were arrived at.  Settings that  make it no worse is a good start, but where are we trying to get to?  Getting that documented will help a lot.\nB. Get your intentions documented about the long term.  Are you going to refactor these to bring them down in size?  Do you need community help and are there people lined up to do these refactors?",
