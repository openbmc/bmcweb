I lean towards being able to report the specific retry policy each time it\u0027s used.\n\nThat being said, I\u0027m all for simplifying the code.

If we rely on the handler to log important retry information, then that won\u0027t provide total coverage to all retry events.\n\nMistake on my end, I thought waitAndRetry() was logging the policy name.  I think arguably it should.  Right now the name is logged when a connection is configured to send a new message so you would have to work backwards if a retry is not triggered by an invalid response code since that is the only other location it is logged (https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/54161/8/http/http_client.hpp#259).\n\nI understand what the ask is.
