      "message": "With great respect to the work you\u0027ve done here, this isn\u0027t something we\u0027d generally maintain at project level given that this script makes a great number of assumptions about your specific workflow, very few of which are likely true across the board or common across developers.  As a general rule, building within yocto is the primary workflow we support through either building real images or qemu.\n\nAlso, fwiw, a less complex version of this script already exists in the root build_x86.sh, so if anything, we would modify that one rather than checking in a new one.\n\nHope that makes sense.",
