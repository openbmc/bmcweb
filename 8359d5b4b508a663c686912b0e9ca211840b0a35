As a general rule, building within yocto is the primary workflow we support through either building real images or qemu.\n\nAlso, fwiw, a less complex version of this script already exists in the root build_x86.sh, so if anything, we would modify that one rather than checking in a new one.\n\nHope that makes sense.",
