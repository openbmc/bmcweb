      "message": "Need to document \"why\".  All DMTF schemas include a description, and all well-formed registries should include a description.  I see no problem for OpenBMC to require a human readable description at this level.  Is there a registry you\u0027re trying to ingest that doesn\u0027t have a description?  I\u0027m assuming that\u0027s something that you should ask the registry author to fix, but without knowing the registry, I can\u0027t suggest how to go about that..",
