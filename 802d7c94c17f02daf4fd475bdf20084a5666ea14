I was hoping it was something like that.\n\nYes, res.openFile() should be functionally much faster, as it skips the string step entirely, and goes directly from filesystem-\u003esocket.  Also, it\u0027s been optimized by people that understand network IO better than we do, so it should be more efficient.\n\nI\u0027ll get the comment and TODO removed.",
