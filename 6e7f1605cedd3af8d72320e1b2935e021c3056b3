      "message": "if you have to start listing your changes, it would generally imply that they should\u0027ve been in their own commits.  But, we\u0027re here now, so lets just roll with it.  I\u0027d like you to put #1 put in its own patch, with an explanation of why it\u0027s needed, and why the current behavior is correct because it\u0027s changing behavior, and that\u0027s really hard to review in a patchset that\u0027s also moving the code its changing.\n\nThe namespace change, if you want to leave it in this commit, I can review it just fine, although it ideally would\u0027ve been in a separate changeset.  Something to keep in mind for next time.",
