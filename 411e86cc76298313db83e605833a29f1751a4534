Someone is going to make an argument that everything the BMC does has some condition where we can\u0027t figure it out.  I\u0027m not on board with that.\n\nIn what I\u0027m proposing, \"We can\u0027t figure this out\" translates to MAXINT.  \"We can\u0027t provide this information on this system\" would be the optional interface.  In general I don\u0027t really see what you say being the case.  Property support tends to be batched together, and even if we end up with an interface per property because we have that wide variety of system support, is that really a problem?\n\nIn this case, the port capabilities likely come from smbios tables, whereas the lanes in use come from directly polling the serdes.  For even that reason I think it still makes sense to separate them, so that multiple services can each host their part of the interface.\n\npeci-pcie sidestepped this by pulling the PCIe information directly from the serdes, but I\u0027d be surprised if that worked on all systems.\n\n\nWith that said, is there something you\u0027re suggesting to handle 1, 2, and 3 above?

My understanding was that the recent change was due to the fact that they wanted to be able to represent 0 lanes in use.  That appears to be what is available now with this change.\n\n\nRight, but now they\u0027ve also represented an error as omitting the property.  Redfish requires that we handle those 3 distinct cases differently, and as it stands now, there\u0027s no way to know the difference between 1, 2, and 3 above.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e This change is really not doing anything with respect to \"errors\" and the existing code didn\u0027t do anything with respect to them either.

If that gets removed, and we handle the case where it\u0027s 0 as an error (because now exposing something that handles 0 lanes is an error) that would be an improvement.",

Redfish differentiates them, so I\u0027m stuck where I can either:\n\u003e \n\u003e No... the change is to make it so that 0 is valid data.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e It\u0027s used for debugging if a link didn\u0027t come up, or if a link downtrained to a lower speed/width. That\u0027s why this interface was implemented in the first place.\n\u003e \n\u003e All of these cases are 0.\n\n\nfrom what got checked in\n```\n\"Deafult value of\n maxint is to accommodate the situation where the value of this\n property is not known due to some unknown reason, like hardware\n failure or link down.\"\n```\n          \nAccording to that, the value for link down is MAXINT, not zero.  Am I misreading that?  That\u0027s basically the crux of the comment I made on the PDI review.  I suspect if \"link down \u003d\u003d 0 lanes\" gets put in, and the backends get updated (and this commit gets changed to actually handle zero as a redfish status of disabled), then I think we\u0027re good.\n\nIt\u0027s imperfect because we still miss out on \"This isn\u0027t supported on this platform\" but I\u0027m happy to kick that can down the road forever, at least for what\u0027s there we can build a correct Redfish API.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e The distinction between \"lane not in use\" and \"not supported on this platform\" is arguably more important than \"Had an internal error\". I just bring it up for completeness.\n\u003e \n\u003e Aren\u0027t these implemented as 0 and maxint represent respectively with the current interface definition?\n\nNot so far as I\u0027m reading in the description.  I see no mention of 0 being a special case anywhere.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e As in, today we propose breaking out this one property, tomorrow we ask to separate every property on dbus? I really don\u0027t think that is going to happen.\n\u003e \n\u003e Nearly every property in the Inventory namespace you could make an argument \"my EEPROM doesn\u0027t contain this data\".\n\nsure, and in those cases, we omit the data from the Redfish schema, so the user-facing result looks right (sometimes by breaking the documentation in PDI by abusing empty string).\n\nIf we\u0027re going with 0 \u003d\u003d lane not used, maxint \u003d\u003d data unavailable, lets get PDI updated, and that should be an improvement to this without having to open the every interface is optional conversation.",

Let\u0027s go ahead and adjust the wording there.\n\nLink down should be \"0 lanes in use\".\n\nI guess I was just so excited that someone finally took care of that commit after 2 years that I didn\u0027t read too deeply on all the words.\n\n\u003e sure, and in those cases, we omit the data from the Redfish schema, so the user-facing result looks right (sometimes by breaking the documentation in PDI by abusing empty string).\n\nYou have the same problem though.  Is \"\" at a dbus property level due to:\n- The eeprom field is empty.\n- The eeprom field is missing.\n- The eeprom field has a bad CRC.\n\n\u003e If we\u0027re going with 0 \u003d\u003d lane not used, maxint \u003d\u003d data unavailable, lets get PDI updated, and that should be an improvement to this without having to open the every interface is optional conversation.\n\n:thumbsup:",
