      "message": "I\u0027d like to see this be a \"strict compliance\" option, which is much more maintainable in the long run, and gives us a place to put all these compliance breaking things.\n\nAt this point, we\u0027ve identified at least 4 things that need to go within this option:\n1. Mutual TLS auth\n2. PATCH on sensor value interface\n3. Cookie auth support (and therefore the webui)\n4. PATCH on bmc/NetworkProtocol hostname\n\nI\u0027m fairly certain there\u0027s more.\n\nMost of the above are already options to be able to build in, so this new option would just check to see if those are enabled.\n\nAlso, for the moment we need strict compatibility to be disabled by default as we want to give a path forward, and not break all the existing functionality.",

Do we allow the webui?\n\nHow do things get removed from the code and dropped from this list? \n\nI\u0027m not sure I agree with the \"strict compliance\" option. With this, \"redfish-allow-deprecated-hostname-patch\" is an option and then later at some point dropped all together.",

      "message": "Gunnar, I prefer the per item enable/disable, despite the possibility of a sea of such compile switches. Creating this as a single enable/disable implies, to me, that all of these features need to be made compliant to the schemas all in one multi-part, nearly contemporary, commit. This would be necessary to have a single expiry time. I don\u0027t think tightening all of the other three (or more) items in the list within a short timeframe to this commit is really practical. OBMC maintainers can\u0027t really assign cross-corporate resources to make such a commit set possible.\n\nAs I stated earlier replies I wasn\u0027t expecting this to evolve into such an involved issue. I didn\u0027t push this because I received a defect. I pushed this because I noticed a deviation from the DMTF spec. The commit was small, and it matched the schema, and my expectation was I\u0027d get a +2 and merge. I didn\u0027t sign up to correct everything out of spec in the bmcweb implementation. I only committed to fixing a variance that needed correcting.\n\nAt this point my takeaway for bmcweb as a whole is that I have to ignore any existing code that is non-compliant to the schemas, and to not attempt to make any changes to what is now canon.\nContribution will now only be for items that don\u0027t exist in bmcweb, and don\u0027t have a built-in conflict due to a pre-existing feature implementation.",
