      "message": "Thinking about it, do we need the branch at all?  Doesn\u0027t the:\nquery.expandLevel -\u003d queryCapabilities.canDelegateExpandLevel;\n\nLine work in both cases (ie if canDeleteExpandLevel \u003d 0, that line is noop).\n\n\nso we\u0027d end up with something like:\nquery.expandLevel -\u003d queryCapabilities.canDelegateExpandLevel;\ndelegated.expandLevel \u003d queryCapabilities.canDelegateExpandLevel;\ndelegated.expandType \u003d query.expandType;\n\n\nI think that covers all the cases, and is less code, right?  It does change the value of query.expandType in the former case, but ExpandType \u003d\u003d All, with depth of 0 is no-op still, so I think it still generalizes.",

      "message": "The only reason I use a branch here is to prevent underflow, both query.expandLevel and queryCapabilities.canDelegateExpandLevel are unsigned integers.\n\nThere might be other tricks we can play, e.g., std::max(0, (int)expandLevel - (int)canDelegateExpandLevel), but it\u0027s less readable IMO.\n\nAlso, I felt setting query.expandType explicitly and not relying on query.expandLevel\u003d0 is safer.\n\nAny more thoughts?",
