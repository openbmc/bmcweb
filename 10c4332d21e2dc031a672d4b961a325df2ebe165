      "message": "5 seconds is arbitrary, just like 30 seconds was. \nI would support 1 or even 0 but 5 was what the client wanted and what has been tested. \n1 and specially 0 would be a bit more risk (cpu/memory of retrying multiple events immediately? not sure this is really much of a concern). Going with 5 today. \nI added this to my commit msg in case someone in the future wasn\u0027t to lower further.",
