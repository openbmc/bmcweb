      "message": "Not sure I agree there.  Gunnar also points out this is an issue.\n\nOne thing I\u0027d like to understand is what \"none\" even means in this context.  From my perspective, \"None\" is the same as \"AlwaysOff\" (ie, on power failure and restore, don\u0027t take any action), so I\u0027d really like to understand why this was added.  From my perspective, unless I\"m missing something, Redfish would just map this to the same thing as AlwaysOff, considering that is the system behavior.\n\nI see Geissler added this new enum a year ago here.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/commit/66b591e165b53a80e431a543aa8c8e48beba585f\n\nAnd it states that the intent is to handle the one_time option, which Redfish doesn\u0027t really seem to support (I think?), so I suspect that we need something like\n\nlookup one time action\nif (none)\n   look up the permenant action.",
