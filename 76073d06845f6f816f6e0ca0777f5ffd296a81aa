      "message": "@gunnar@gmills.xyz \n\n\u003e Why can\u0027t both multi computer system and single computer system both use the contained_by association ?\n\nThey can, if single-host platforms migrate to use the topology design we have implemented in EM.\n\nAlso - with what we currently have - `systemName` has to be equals the identifier used on dbus for the object that represents the computer system (i.e the baseboard, but really anything that implements the Item.System interface as per PDI [1]). Currently, that seems to be difficult with default systemName `system`. It can be circumvented with BMCWEB_REDFISH_SYSTEM_URI_NAME, however I don\u0027t think, this should be the way to go.\n\nFrom my understanding, if we don\u0027t put it behind the multi-host option now, then almost every - if not every - single-host platform will lose the link to chassis, that previously has been there.\n\nSo far I have seen that as a regression, which is why I suggested to put it behind the multi-host option. But on the other hand, it is a progression towards a design that already has been defined. [2] \n\nI would like to hear yours and @ed@tanous.net opinion on that.\n\nWith multi-host we started to introduce associations more, than single-hosts are currently using and plan on adding more. Ideally both platform types can use the same associations so that we have a single code path serving both, which I think we agree on. From past discussions at least, I got the impression, that is the direction we wanted to steer towards in bmcweb.\n\nThe way we currently implement associations however, we don\u0027t do this. [3][4] \nThey are put behind the multi-host option, because most of single-host will not work as they previously did, if we wouldn\u0027t put it behind the option. \n\nIf that is a topic that needs to be discussed in more detail, I am happy to continue on discord.\n  \n[1] https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/85082 \n[2] https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/physical-topology.md\n[3] https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/83773\n[4] https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/83945",
