This isn\u0027t a \"Ed and Gunnar require\" thing, it\u0027s a documented project level requirement for all code submissions.

It was more about the fact, that a Tested: section is already provided and whether I should add my testing too. \n\nBut as the doc describes, manual testing is expected, hence I shouldn\u0027t have to ask you two specifically as it is documented. Again sorry, that one is on me.\n\nLet me rephrase my last comment:\nI did test your implementation on my test setup. Everything works as expected. Thank you! If you are fine with it, I can update the the commit message for you, since manual testing results are required in this patch.",
