      "message": "Hi, an \"xyz.openbmc_project.Chassis.Intrusion\" interface is defined under the xyz/openbmc_project/Chassis folder in PDI which inspired me to use *Chassis* as the prefix path (there might also be a fan intrusion sensor which can take another prefix) and *Intrusion* as the name of the sensor (because I saw some object paths like \"/xyz/openbmc_project/Chassis/Control/NMISource\" to hold the interface \"xyz.openbmc_project.Chassis.Control.NMISource\" which is a reasonable relation).  I\u0027m not sure about how to add a new interface definition to better fit the new object path. Can you please help clarify a bit and correct my understanding if it\u0027s wrong?",
