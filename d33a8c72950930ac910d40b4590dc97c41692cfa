They\u0027re a regression for the moment with the *_formatters stuff.\n\nIf you want to keep going on your own, please just delete the changeid from the commit and it will generate a new review that you can continue, and we can compare at the end.",

      "message": "I forked this commit to 77557 and I think the most of compilation issues seem fixed by the changesets\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/77557/4..8\n\nHowever, there are remaining issues related to the generated message files by `scripts/parse_registries.py`.  I attempted to fix those by\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/77557/8..10\n\nBut I think we may need to add some pragma statement on those generated message files (which are generated by `scripts/parse_registries.py`)   like\n\n```\n\n#pragma clang diagnostic push \n#pragma clang diagnostic ignored \"-Wunused\"\n...\n#pragma clang diagnostic pop\n```",
