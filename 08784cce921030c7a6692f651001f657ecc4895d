(Looks like it was when James was the maintainer).\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/32883\n\nWe need to be careful here about backward compatibility, given that there are VERY likely:\n\n1. Folks using bmcweb for non-redfish usages (and should be relying on the web group)\n2. Folks that don\u0027t have either group assigned to their users they created long ago.\n\nIf we suddenly start enforcing this requirement, without any migrations, it\u0027s likely we will lock some people out of their systems.\n\nHave you considered the possibility this might cause a breaking change to some people?\n\nHave you considered that we might need two pam files, one for checking the web user group and one for checking the redfish user group (or checking for both)?",
