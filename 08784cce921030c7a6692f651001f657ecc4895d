(Looks like it was when James was the maintainer).\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/32883\n\nWe need to be careful here about backward compatibility, given that there are VERY likely:\n\n1. Folks using bmcweb for non-redfish usages (and should be relying on the web group)\n2. Folks that don\u0027t have either group assigned to their users they created long ago.\n\nIf we suddenly start enforcing this requirement, without any migrations, it\u0027s likely we will lock some people out of their systems.\n\nHave you considered the possibility this might cause a breaking change to some people?\n\nHave you considered that we might need two pam files, one for checking the web user group and one for checking the redfish user group (or checking for both)?",

If you\u0027ve already done that work, lets just get it documented with commit sha1s and expected behaviors.  Just to be clear, bricking someones bmc by locking them out of it is unacceptable in all cases.\n\n\u003e It\u0027s more like release process, e.g. in such case we could put messages in the release notes indicating that this upgrade should do a factory reset.\n\nA factory reset has never been required in any other bmc release.  I\u0027m not sure why we would start requiring one now.  If you would like to change that, we need to start a mailing list discussion.\n\n\u003e I am not sure.
