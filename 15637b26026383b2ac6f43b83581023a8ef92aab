      "message": "We currently don\u0027t store the Name since there isn\u0027t an obvious for it in the boost::urls::url object that holds the information.  We could do something like storing it as a param \"Name\u003d\u003cName\u003e\" or just as the path.  Or make the object a little more generic than just boost::urls::url so that we could utilize other types of aggregation instead of just HTTP/ethernet based connections.\n\nMy preference is to leave this to its own patch (especially if we opt for option 2).",
