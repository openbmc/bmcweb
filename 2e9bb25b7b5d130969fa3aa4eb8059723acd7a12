      "message": "Also, LDAP notification in the library isn\u0027t required to host the privilege level.\n\nThe reason most web services like this even have sessions is to avoid doing this exact thing, calling into ldap for every single request, which slows down everything.  Sessions are generally only authorized once, then that privilege level is held through the course of the session.\n\nThis is the same way your laptop works with an LDAP server.  If your privilege level on the LDAP server is changed, it\u0027s not immediately applied, you need to log out and log back in before it\u0027s applied.",

Considering bmcweb is supposed to respond in a matter of milliseconds, adding another milliseconds hop to every request seems like an issue.\n\nConsidering that bmcweb is logging in via PAM directly, I would expect the getgrent to also be in bmcweb, so we can authorize users and determine their groups without any intermediates, at the same time we do the pam_authenticate call.  With that said, I don\u0027t have a problem authorizing through dbus, I have a problem authorizing every request.  If you have requirements around supporting removing sessions when the groups change (which is fairly unique) then phosphor-user-manager needs to set up inotify, and event on them properly.",
