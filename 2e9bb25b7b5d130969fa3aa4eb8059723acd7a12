      "message": "Also, LDAP notification in the library isn\u0027t required to host the privilege level.\n\nThe reason most web services like this even have sessions is to avoid doing this exact thing, calling into ldap for every single request, which slows down everything.  Sessions are generally only authorized once, then that privilege level is held through the course of the session.\n\nThis is the same way your laptop works with an LDAP server.  If your privilege level on the LDAP server is changed, it\u0027s not immediately applied, you need to log out and log back in before it\u0027s applied.",

There is a nsswitch configuration where we tells that for password, grpup search what should be called(Linux, ldap).\n\nI am not sure that internally these API makes the LDAP call for each request to get the grpup name or it caches somewhere.but I have seen most of the times that LDAP call goes to the LDAP server for the authorization but it is very fast(in mili or micro seconds) as our ldap server is in the same network.",
