      "message": "What does the DCMI specification have to do with this?  This is Redfish, which isn\u0027t governed by that specification.\n\nAlso, I\u0027m looking at table 6-18, and I see no such mention of logging into Redfish.  In section 6.3 I do see\n```\nSystem Event Logging (SEL) provides the necessary logging for DCMI. SEL can be uploaded,\ncleared by the in-band and out-of-band agents using the defined IPMI commands.\n```\n\nMaybe you intended to commit this to IPMI?\n\n\nIf your intent was to commit this to Redfish, please take a look at the Power registry, that I believe covers this use case for the Redfish spec.\n\n\nPlease note, a lot more detail in this commit message is needed if it\u0027s to proceed.  One sentence is rarely enough for a full new feature.",
