This is Redfish, which isn\u0027t governed by that specification.\n\u003e \nIn the DCMI, it only mentions SEL log, but I saw that in the bmcweb repo, it defined \"PowerLimitException\", therefore, we need to add Redfish log also (https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/static/redfish/v1/JsonSchemas/Power/Power.json#L586)\n\n\u003e Also, I\u0027m looking at table 6-18, and I see no such mention of logging into Redfish.
