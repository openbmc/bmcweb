Also, this template code is basically copied from the readJson handler, so if it\u0027s wrong, we\u0027d never really know.\n\nYes, I know that spreading this out isn\u0027t very DRY, but it does uses that would actually happen in code, and use EXPECT statements to signal what the expected postconditions are.",
