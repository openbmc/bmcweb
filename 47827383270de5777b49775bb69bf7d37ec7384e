I was almost positve that this \u0027.clang-ignore\u0027 file was something of our own invention.\n\nThis search shows no hits: https://github.com/search?q\u003dorg%3Allvm-mirror+clang-ignore\u0026type\u003dcode\n\nSearching for \u0027clang-ignore\u0027, \u0027clang-format-ignore\u0027 and \u0027clang-tidy-ignore\u0027 on your favorite search engine reveals almost nothing relevant except feature request issues on Github or this Meson stuff.\n\nThe run-clang-tidy source only has the word \"ignore\" in an unrelated part:\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/2e999b7dd1934a44d38c3a753460f1e5a217e9a5/clang-tools-extra/clang-tidy/tool/run-clang-tidy.py#L183\n\n\u003e Given the tiny footprint, it seems like overkill to remove, unless it\u0027s actually blocking some other thing that\u0027s more important?\n\nYou\u0027re welcome to leave it in place.  I was just cleaning up all of them because they seemed to have been a relic of the previous clang-format code not using git-ls-files and people having issues with subprojects having a different formatting scheme.",
