      "message": "Maybe this could have a little more discussion about why?  A timeout is an unexpected error during a websocket flow.  I could see an argument that could be made for error -\u003e warning, because it\u0027s not a fatal error, but it is unexpected in a \"correct\" context where there\u0027s no network failures.  Closing a websocket correctly should result in a canceled message here (because the connection was gracefully closed).",
