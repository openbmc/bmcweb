It is up to the Routing Advertisement packet to asert the M or the O bit in order to complete DNS functionality. Those bits are not controlled by the BMC, but by the routers IPv6 configuration.",

Specifically it meant IPv6AcceptRA\u003dtrue, DHCPv6Client\u003dtrue, assuming systemd.networkd configuration file nomenclature.\n\"Stateless\" meant IPv6AcceptRA\u003dtrue, DHCPv6Client\u003dfalse.\n\"Disabled\" indicated both of these controls would be set false.\n\nFollowing the above paradigm eliminates the need for the \"WithoutRA\u003dsolicit\" commit I have -1\u0027d for phosphor-network.\n\nNow I have no idea what \"Enabled\" means here. In addition, according to the Redfish schema there is no \"Enabled\" DHCPv6OperatingMode entry.\n\nI also don\u0027t understand why StatelessAddressAutoConfiguration was added to the schema. It only has an \"enabled\"/\"disabled\" mode. Again, SLAAC should only be toggling DHCPv6Client in the systemd.networkd config file. We already had that ability in the \"Stateless\" DHCPv6OperatingMode  part of the schema.",
