If that\u0027s what you intended, more details need to be in your commit message about why.\n\nDoing what you said in your commit message seems reasonable to me.  Doing what your patchset does (removing the option entirely) doesn\u0027t, given that a lot of people don\u0027t want the journal logs exposed from Redfish, and prefer a more \"Appliance\" style on their manageability interface.",
