      "message": "hmm.. I am not sure I understood. What I am saying is this : \n\nThe issue that is there for DIMM ( Associations.Definitions OR Item.Dimm ), is also there for CPU ( Associations.DEfinitions OR Item.Cpu ). So, we need to have this for CPU also.\n\nAlso, I believe we need this for PATCH also since we are again looking at GetSubTree with more than 1 interfaces.\n\n\n------------\n\nWe could really do the other thing  ( I think it makes it simple )\n\n- Let Processor and Dimm only look for Inventory.Item.Cpu / Item.Dimm\n- getLocationIndicatorActive and setLocationIndicatorActive can use Associations.Definitions and filter by D-Bus object path. When it is done this way, then it is for SURE that the D-Bus object is CPU -and- is implementing Associations + Item.Cpu\n\nand the same applies to Dimm.",
