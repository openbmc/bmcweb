      "message": "We should run our Redfish Validator as part of CI. We don\u0027t. Compute resources are one of the things holding us back. \nWe should have more testing to make sure endpoints aren\u0027t broken. We don\u0027t. Getting developers to buy into Unit testing, etc, has been a struggle.  \n\nSo we require some manual testing for each commit. Janet pointed out how an earlier patchset of this commit was broken (missing the route).. Since this is a refactor, verifying the output matches what was there before is a reasonable test. That is the kind of testing we expect with each commit.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/efe29ab5ffd86b01d4848b470a14e29c54ecae43/docs/TESTING.md?plain\u003d1#L4\n\nThat said, this is unlikely to break anything, and I would be okay with it going without the testing above. However, this is a complex enough change that I would really like to see some testing... And for the future, I really want to see testing on changes like this.",

Like Gunnar says, this patch is pretty easy to verify correctness based on a code review, but presumably refactoring isn\u0027t the scope of what you wanted to do with openbmc/bmcweb, so at some point, you\u0027ll need those qemu targets.  If you\u0027re on discord, I\u0027m happy to help show you how I operate for most changes in qemu, which really isn\u0027t too bad to set up.\n\nFWIW, you\u0027re welcome to use one of the two qemu targets I use upstream (nvidia-gb200-nvl72-bmc or s7106) as those models already exist and have been upstreamed.",
