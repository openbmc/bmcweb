      "message": "I see what you did here, and while it\u0027s clever, I don\u0027t think it solves the problem.  The issue here is that just adding these generic things to the description doesn\u0027t really help to determine what it should be used for.  Some common things that this doesn\u0027t solve:\n\nWhat if there are two hosts?  What if there are two different types of hosts?\n\nWhat if there are multiple types of BMC?\n\nWhat would a user do with an \"Other\" description?\n\nWhat would a user do with an \"Unknown\" description?\n\n\nThere was a description on this with the VR work that other google guys are doing, in that there\u0027s a compatibility string, I suspect this patchset needs to incorporate some of that in its design.",
