      "message": "I am ready to get rid of this include list. \nIt got added here: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/39901/4 because Redfish keeps adding schemas https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/39864/4 \n\nEd has your thoughts changed? \nNote: we (IBM) have plenty of flash on our systems now so my opinion is influenced by that. The allow list is a pain. \n\nEd Tanous (from 39864)\nHow much does this add to our binary footprint?\n\nWe probably should\u0027ve drawn the line in the sand on the 2020.1 schema, when Redfish added a ton of new schemas and took up ~800KB of our flash space. We need to come up with a solution to the binary size problem, as we can\u0027t just keep going down the road of adding new schema packs. Adding the whole pack made sense when OpenBMC implemented ~40% of the schemas provided, but now that we\u0027re only implementing ~5% of the schema pack, and redfish keeps expanding, installing the whole thing seems like a huge waste, and considering that equivalent binary-size-inducing patches that add less size have been held up because of the binary footprint, we should probably investigate that on this patchset as well.",
