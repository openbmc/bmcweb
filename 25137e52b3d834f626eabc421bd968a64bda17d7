      "message": "Because on line 550 we modify the object (ie erase the value).  Modifying the map while iterating invalidates any iterators in the map, but erase() solves this by returning an iterator to the NEXT item after the item that was erased, thus giving a way to erase items while still only iterating the map once.\n\nSo far as I\u0027m aware, there\u0027s no way to do that with a range based for loop.  If there is, I\u0027d be super interested to know about it.",
