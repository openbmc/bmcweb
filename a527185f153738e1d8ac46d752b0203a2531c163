The old code used a capture by span\u003cstring_view\u003e as well.\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/86d89ed7ad605b0f7dbe2c11200363fd34c6364c/redfish-core/lib/sensors.hpp#L286\n\nwhich is why this does it.  With that said, this is certainly a place to be improved to use an owning object, even if it\u0027s a copy;  I can take a look at it in another patch.",
