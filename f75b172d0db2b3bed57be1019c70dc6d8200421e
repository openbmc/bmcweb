      "message": "The next patch adds `RelatedItem` in multi-host case.\n\nThat\u0027s why i wanted to have some consistency also in the single-host case.\n\nSome may view this as redundant to add `RelatedItem` but i would prefer the redfish client be able to rely on it somewhat, to always find a system which is associated to the software inventory item.\n\nWe have to check the option here because if the multi-host option is enabled it is not allowed anymore to do hardcoding such as `BMCWEB_REDFISH_SYSTEM_URI_NAME`.\n\n\nLet me know if i should abandon the patch.",
