Do we call them \"advanced\" if they\u0027re in many examples in the std, I\u0027m not sure, but bmcweb uses them in a lot of cases.  Now that we\u0027re on c++14, we could annotate the return type to make it more clear (ie \n\n[this](bool preverified, boost::asio::ssl::verify_context\u0026 ctx)-\u003ebool\n\nBut thusfar, we haven\u0027t been enforcing this in bmcweb/openbmc, as it is a new feature of the standard.\n\nIt should be noted, I personally dislike this lambda, given it\u0027s giant, and obfuscates intent, but I didn\u0027t write it.  Cleaning it up is outside the scope of this patch (but rest assured, will be cleaned up in a future patch).\n\n\n\u003e But I don\u0027t see any returns that are not true either.  they are all just debug log hooks?\n\nThe return value determines whether or not we should fail the SSL handshake because of a failed client cert.  Because OpenBMC supports other, non Mutual TLS auth mechanisms, we can\u0027t completely close the connection if mtls auth fails.\n\nInterestingly, you\u0027ve found a \"bug\" IMO.  See discussion here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/CACWQX80QSyf95+ibN24nwiAdNLCtdWOQdsgqaHvVbdEG9b8jbA@mail.gmail.com/\n\nThe fix mention has yet to be submitted to the tree by anyone (it\u0027s on my list).\n\nWith that said, this too is outside the scope of this patchset, this function wasn\u0027t changed, simply moved scopes (hence the changes in indent changes that you\u0027re seeing).",

If you ask for non-SSL, it politely (ie 307 redirect) points you to the SSL implementation.  If you ask for SSL, it just works.  \"requiring\" a particular port match a particular protocol would cause the example in the commit message, as well as non-standard ports to no longer forward correctly.  I\u0027ve personally seen this behavior on commercial BMCs non-standard ports, and it\u0027s very annoying when you type in http://\u003cmybmc\u003e:4000 and the redirects fail to work.",

If the client is using a non-standard port, yes, it would redirect them to use HTTPS on that non-standard port, which is I think the best we can do there (and is explicitly not functional on a lot of BMC implementations I know of).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e If not how does it decide which port to direct clients toward?\n\nIt doesn\u0027t, it either uses the browsers/clients preference (which forwards to 443 correctly) or, if the port is explicit, forwards to the same port, just using the SSL protocol.",
