      "message": "I assume you are recommending that because arg3 is needed to point to the other resource so we can _only_ use the URI so that the user who got this error, can get the conflicted resource details since the user might look or adjust something in that resource to perform the operation that is needed to him.\n\nOR you are recommending boost::url_view to prepare the URI in the right format? If so, can you point me to the code where we are framing the URI in the bmcweb by using the boost::url_view? I am only seeing reverse i.e the bmcweb using when they are getting URI as part of the user request, not in the response?\n\nOR can I just pass \"/redfish/v1/XXXX\"? - https://master.url.cpp.al/url/ref/boost__urls__url_view/url_view/overload3.html?",
