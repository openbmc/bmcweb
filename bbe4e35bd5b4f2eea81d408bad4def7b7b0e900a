The intent is to clear the log and on subsequent queries there should be on logs returned, if there were none produced in the meantime.\n\nWhat is happening on the bmc to implement this clearing is an implementation detail. The user does not need to care about it. If during clearing of the log we create ```didclear.txt``` and write 3 prime numbers to that file the client does not care.",
