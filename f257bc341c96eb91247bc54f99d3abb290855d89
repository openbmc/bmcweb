Since these helpers partially run on single-host aswell, calling the file \u0027multi_host\u0027 might be a bit misleading. Also, looking at the current file structure, splitting this into hpp and cpp files does not align with the rest of the repo.",

Refer to https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sf2-a-header-file-must-not-contain-object-definitions-or-non-inline-function-definitions\n\nAnd marking things `inline` does not necessarily makes things faster or smaller.\nhttps://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/inline-functions\n\nIt\u0027s probably just a waste of time to do that and makes the build slower.\n\n\n\n\u003e calling the file \u0027multi_host\u0027 might be a bit misleading.\n\nI wanted to have a separate file for Ed to be able to throw out in case the code does not develop into something worthwhile.",
