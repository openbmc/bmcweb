      "message": "Since this CL doesn\u0027t use the information I store in the map, I\u0027m not sure how much that change will simplify this patchset.  Are you referring to not also setting up a D-Bus match for new satellites like Benjamin requested in his comment?  If so I can move that into a subsequent CL and just focus on breaking up the config loading code.\n\nWill I need to wait until that \"cache dbus data\" mechanism is added before I can store the satellite config info?  I\u0027m planning to use the presence of satellite config info as an indicator that Redfish Aggregation is enabled.  Going to D-Bus every time will slow down not just aggregation operations, but also every endpoint that supports aggregation.  I want to double check that the future slowdown is alright for that as well.",
