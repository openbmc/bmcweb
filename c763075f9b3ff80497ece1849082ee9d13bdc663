      "message": "will remove this. I had it when I was debugging.\n\nSo basically, I have the log service link to any chassis that that is created. The logs will/can be link to one of the devices under the chassis. Each Chassis is created by Item.Board or Item.Chassis. With EntityManager, any Fru with type Board will create a chassis in bmcweb... \n\nSo I utilize that to create a log service under that chassis to manager all the logs that is related to that Chassis.\n\nI have added some more details in the commit message.",
