I tried to get a special error code for this purpose in\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/82723/comment/5adb7705_8c50ebfd/\n\nbut got a review that\n\n\u003e This is already being done via Unavailable error code, so we don\u0027t need a new code here for InProgress.\n\nIMO the \"update in progress\" scenario is meaningfully different from a service being unavailable since it could be unavailable due to other reason like power state transition or something else.\n\n\"update in progress\" is a specific error condition which should ideally always go away in a *reasonable* amount of time.\n\nIt\u0027s the most specific error message i can think of that we can emit here.\n\nI can go with `ServiceTemporarilyUnavailable` if it\u0027s required but i would prefer to have a more specific error.",
