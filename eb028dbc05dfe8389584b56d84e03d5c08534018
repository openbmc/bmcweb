      "message": "This was disabled by default on purpose. \nThere was discord discussion around this before this change was done. \nThe HealthRollup design is half baked (I think it was a start but since hasn\u0027t been pushed) and hasn\u0027t been supported. It only covers a handful of resources in bmcweb. \nhttps://github.com/search?q\u003drepo%3Aopenbmc%2Fbmcweb%20health.hpp\u0026type\u003dcode\n\nI am okay with a HealthRollup design but a HealthRollup design needs to address how it interacts with https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/d1484a1499bc241316853934e6e8b735166deee2/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Decorator/OperationalStatus.interface.yaml#L4\n\nThe interfaces for the design need to in phosphor-dbus-interfaces, performance needs to be accounted for, and it needs to be supported across all bmcweb resources\n\nDiscord discussion: https://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/855566794994221117/1110731215343976482",
