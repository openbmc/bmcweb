      "message": "I don\u0027t understand why people wouldn\u0027t be using phoshor-state-manager. I personally would rather bmcweb go to D-Bus for this. I think of bmcweb\u0027s Redfish implementation as a D-Bus \u003c-\u003e Redfish translation. Anytime bmcweb goes to systemd directly makes the bmcweb Redfish architecture more complex. It feels like we are putting phosphor-state-manager logic into bmcweb. That said, I guess since people aren\u0027t using phoshor-state-manager or a completing app that could implement the D-Bus for this, this is as good as it gets today maybe. I do want this function into Redfish.\nI personally think https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/50318 is a better direction. If people don\u0027t use phosphor-state-manager, they get some default. If  phosphor-state-manager isn\u0027t started, some default is returned.",
