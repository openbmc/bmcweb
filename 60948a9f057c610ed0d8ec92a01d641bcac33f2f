If reverting that portion of the refactor is the correct thing to do then it is what it is.\n\nIs your thought to give the RedfishAggregator and the EventServiceManager classes their own HttpClient members?  Then the constructor of HttpClient could in some way accept an argument for the response read limit and that will eventually propagate into the connection objects.",
