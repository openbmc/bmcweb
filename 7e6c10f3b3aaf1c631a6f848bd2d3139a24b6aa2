The prototypes of these change in the next commit, and in a way that makes them a lot easier to test so it didn\u0027t make a ton of sense to write some really complex tests (constructing Response and Request objects) just to delete them in the next commit.\n\nHappy to restructure if there\u0027s a way that makes these easier to review.",
