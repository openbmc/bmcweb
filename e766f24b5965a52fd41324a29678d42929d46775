These two args get put into the string:\n\n```\nThe property \u0027\u003cArg1\u003e\u0027 could not be written because its value would conflict\nwith the value of the \u0027\u003cArg2\u003e\u0027 property.\n```\n\nbut you\u0027ve put a full string in Arg2, so the the produced message isn\u0027t going to make sense.\n\n\nI\u0027d expect something like:\n\nThe property \u0027IPv4StaticAddresses/1/Gateway\u0027 could not be written because its value would conflict with the value of the \u0027IPv4StaticAddresses/0/Gateway\u0027\n\n\nthe pathString variable has the IPv4StaticAddresses/1 part already for you.  I suspect you need to track the last path in gatewayValueAssigned, and change it to a string.",
