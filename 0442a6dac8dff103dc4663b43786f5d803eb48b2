      "message": "Considering that by design we shouldn\u0027t be throwing exceptions at this level at all, I didn\u0027t apply a lot of effort to it.  There\u0027s some subtleties around this, I think the real fix here is to make sure this patch can\u0027t throw at all, but finding the spot that\u0027s possible to throw is difficult, and has subtleties (apparently boost::vector can throw on construction, std::vector can\u0027t).  If it\u0027s really important that this gets changed, I can, but it doesn\u0027t seem that important to the overall goal, and I\u0027d rather leave it as-is.",
