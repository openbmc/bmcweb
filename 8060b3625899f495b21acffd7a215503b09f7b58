      "message": "I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ve ever really enforced that we need to use auto on BOTH sides of an argument.  The thing I generally comment on is some variation of\n\nauto foo \u003d myOpaqueMethodCall();\n\nWhere it\u0027s not obvious in that context what the return type is, and more importantly, if myOpaqueMethodCall() changes from say uint64_t, to int64_t, there\u0027s no change to the call site that would make us check if that transform was safe.\n\nThis is only really changing stuff like\n\nFoo foo \u003d static_cast\u003cFoo\u003e(myFoo);\n\nWhich, auto seems perfrectly fine.  Foo is already declared on the line, and there\u0027s no way that static_cast will ever change to return Bar, without that line changing.",
