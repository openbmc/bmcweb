      "message": "I\u0027ve read the above, and it doesn\u0027t sound like this behavior is specific to redfish.  Is that right?  If we need to be deleting the gateway at the same time as the ip, is that logic that networkd should be doing?\n\nThe other thing I\u0027m not understanding in this patch is I see no matching or handling for if there are multiple IP addresses.  Imagine the case where we have\n\nIPAddresses: [\"1.1.1.2\", \"1.1.1.3\"]\nGateway: \"1.1.1.1\"\n\nAnd I sent:\n\nPATCH IPAddresses: [{}, nullptr]\n\nThis code as written would still clear the gateway, even though the gateway is still valid in the ip address that remains.\n\nI could also imagine a case where someone deletes an ip address before creating another, but expects the gateway to persist.  In CRUD we would want to keep the Gateway in place in that case, right?\n\nWhat I\u0027m not quite understanding is the part where:\n\n\u003e Without explicit removal the network is left in a condition\nthat may prevent IP traffic from being able to be sent from the\nBMC. \n\nYou\u0027re deleting the BMC IP address, of course the network can\u0027t send IP traffic without an IP address.  I must be missing something here in what\u0027s expected or the setup?\n\nAny visibility you can give would be good.",
