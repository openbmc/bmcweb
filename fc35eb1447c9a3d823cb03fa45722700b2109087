      "message": "(continuing from the PS4 comment)\nWe discussed this in the 2020-01-20 meeting on the OpenBMC security working group https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b7x9BaxsfcukQDqbvZsU2ehMq4xoJRQvLxxsDUWmAOI\nThere are some use cases to disable the HTTPS interface, for example, on a BMC controlled by KCS.  Therefore this interface is worthwhile to add to BMCWeb.  We discussed the idea of using a \"block list\" to block users from disabling HTTPS; that block list would not be in BMCWeb but would be at the D-Bus API layer (xyz.openbmc_project.Control.Service.Attributes at /xyz/openbmc_project/control/service/).  The default would be that HTTPS is blocked (meaning it would always stay enabled).\n\nWith this model, the D-Bus service manager would handle scenarios where the user locks themselves out.  For example, if IPMI and HTTPS are the only two interfaces available, then the service manager should not allow both of them to be disabled.\n\nDoes this resolve this comment?  If so, I propose creating an issue to enhance the service manager, and proceed with this commit.",
