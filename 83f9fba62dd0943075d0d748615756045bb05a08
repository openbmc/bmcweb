That way, if/when it gets upstreamed, it has fewer merge conflicts\nB. Different routes are separate by folders.  At some point, it seems very likely that we split redfish-core into redfish-core and redfish-dbus, given that there are those are are using bmcweb to build their own custom non-openbmc implementations.  I want to be able to support that open source effort without imposing a lot of overhead on openbmc or the submitters.  Separating the code on a backend boundary seems like a start to that.\nC. We can decide which code needs to \"die\" or is unmaintained.  For example, I think the dbus-rest stuff is dead, but I don\u0027t really want to delete the code entirely because I suspect there\u0027s people still using it.  Separating it out into a folder means we can remove it from the majority of the CI/build (and subsequently take back the compile time improvements) and if folks want to continue to compile/maintain it, they can propose themselves as reviewers/maintainers and turn it back on.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e E.g. \n\u003e Why move some of the webui code here, but not all of it like https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/include/webassets.hpp ?\n\nwebassets isn\u0027t specific to the UI, so I was somewhat treating it like \"generic\" code, although I could certainly see the argument it should be a \"backend\".  It also has some weirdness where the http layer interacts with it for maintaining the allowlist, so it\u0027s non-trivial to move in this commit.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e Even the lines for \n\u003e http/\n\u003e redfish-core/ \n\u003e Can get a little blurry\n\nMaybe I\u0027ve looked at this too long, but the way I see it:\nhttp -\u003e is this a generic HTTP/RFC concept?\nredfish-core -\u003e Is this a Redfish concept?\n\nThe only big piece of overlap today is privileges, and in the future at some point I\u0027d like to fix that.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e E.g. \n\u003e https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/include/async_resp.hpp I would think would fit better in http/\n\nAgreed, but it\u0027s not a backend, so I didn\u0027t really move it in this commit which is focusing on breaking out backends.  Honestly, I think the whole AsyncResp class could go away and just be merged with Response, but that\u0027s a problem for another day.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/include/sessions.hpp is in include/ but then there are similar redfish utils at https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/tree/master/redfish-core/include/utils\n\nThat\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m starting to clean up with https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/65720\n\nbut again, unrelated to breaking out backends.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e There are still some \"Redfish\" hits in http/\n\u003e https://github.com/search?q\u003drepo%3Aopenbmc%2Fbmcweb+redfish+NOT+path%3A%2F%5Eredfish-core%5C%2F%2F+NOT+path%3A%2F%5Etest%5C%2F%2F+path%3A%2F%5Ehttp%5C%2F%2F\u0026type\u003dcode\n\u003e \n\u003e A more traditional C++ project of high-level dirs of src/ include/ lib/ is what I would lean towards.
