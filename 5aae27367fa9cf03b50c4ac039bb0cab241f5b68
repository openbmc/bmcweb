But...bmcweb has a lot of dependencies. Do we add them all?\n\nPer the original design, no.  The only thing bmcweb circa 2019 required was pam, and that was guaranteed to be up at all times, so in practice, during bootup, what you got was a possibly incomplete, but still fully functional redfish tree, which there were a lot of good use cases for when things failed (ie, if a daemon fails to launch, it\u0027s nice to go to the journal and figure out why).\n\n\u003e We definitely hit an issue related to this specific dependency on our p10bmc system (client was trying to connect before user-manager was available and client ended up reporting an error).

      "message": "\u003e we should guarantee authentication works at all times\n\nI agree in principle and have questions about the design.\n\nThe authentication provided by Linux-PAM is immediately followed by getting the user\u0027s Redfish RoleId (Administrator, ReadOnly, etc.) which is provided solely by the phosphor user manager (xyz.openbmc_project.User.Manager) service.\n\nSo if the information provided by this service is not available, then BMCWeb\u0027s Redfish service will not know the authenticated user\u0027s role, so it cannot assign privileges which are needed for the authority checks.\n\nWhat should BMCWeb do in that case?  One of? (1) Return HTTP status 503 (Service Unavailable)?  (2) Check authority with secure defaults (that is, no privileges)?  (3) Other ideas?\nI\u0027m leaning toward status 503.
