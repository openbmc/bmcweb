It\u0027s not clear that all systems actually need this dependency, so I\u0027m a little worried we\u0027re adding things unnecessarily.  This also puts openbmc-specific services in the core, which prevents bmcweb from being used by other projects, like openrmc.",

      "message": "The \"After\" will only take affect if that service happens to be started on the particular system. It doesn\u0027t require the service be present (i.e. the Wants/Requires). But...bmcweb has a lot of dependencies. Do we add them all? We definitely hit an issue related to this specific dependency on our p10bmc system (client was trying to connect before user-manager was available and client ended up reporting an error). What\u0027s the right answer for our clients to handle this scenario if we can\u0027t guarantee authentication will work?",
