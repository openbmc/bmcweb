Please see the Assembly commit, we have added a chassis association to assemblies and used that to determine containment.\n\nI\u0027ll let Ed comment here, but I would say we need a similar association here.",

      "message": "Sorry, I don\u0027t know why we can\u0027t base on D-Bus object paths. We used D-Bus to check the chassisID(line 283).I think all PCIeSlots fall into these chassises(https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/39970/26/redfish-core/include/utils/chassis_utils.hpp#21).\n\nMany of the existing schemas need to be modified, for example Sensor schema and Fan schema and PowerSupply schema need to determine if they actually belong to the chassisID. So I want to do it in a very simple way.\n\nAdding a chassis association to PCIeSlot and used that to determine containment is also a good idea.",
