At a minimum, given that \"Operator\" privilege is intended to have access to the system, hence the word operator, it\u0027s not clear why we\u0027d deny them access to the KVM, given that is part of the interfaces for operating the system.\n\nLets start by getting a description of what you\u0027re trying to accomplish from a security perspecive, then we can go about figuring out what to do.",

      "message": "The operator privilege level is not supposed to be able to change configurations that can change the behavior of the out of band interfaces. Removing the IPMI privilege level of \"Operator\" from being able to launch KVM, SOL, or Remote Media access is taking a more conservative approach when accessing the host OS. The host OS being one of the most valuable assets needing to be protected. Understanding that others may have a different position, this should be a configurable policy control to allow for stricter policies.",
