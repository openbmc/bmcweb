      "message": "It is a DEBUG statement; if you turn on DEBUG, it is like 100+ traces per request. \nI guess 20? traces on startup for DEBUG don\u0027t feel like that big of a deal. That said, I don\u0027t see a lot of value in the trace itself (maybe like seeing that bmcweb got the etag but that doesn\u0027t feel like a practical use to me..) \n\nA lot of the debug traces don\u0027t seem valuable to me. If this one is annoying, I am good removing but I think this logic could be applied to a lot of other DEBUG traces. All these maybe useful in some corner case traces is why if you enable DEBUG you are going to get a lot of traces and I think that is okay... No one should be running production in DEBUG but it should be helpful to the developer for finding a slew of problems.",
