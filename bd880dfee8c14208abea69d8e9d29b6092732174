The problem we hit on these generated files is that we want them to exactly match what the script does, and the script doesn\u0027t directly call clang-format.  In theory, if the script picked a different header formatting than clang-format, (which is a little unlikely we wouldn\u0027t just fix it) we would want the clang-format off where it is, because those lines were generated.",
