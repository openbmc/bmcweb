      "message": "More details needed here:\n\n1. This is a breaking change to the API.  How do we plan on rolling it out?\n2. What supported resource/API do we expect clients to move to instead?\n3. How will we warn/document that we\u0027re breaking the API in this way?\n4. Why are we changing this at all?  \"the protocol says so\" is a mediocre reason IMO.  There\u0027s plenty of places we \"break\" the protocol in this way, do you plan on fixing all of them?\n5. What are the dates of the bmcweb instances that were broken?  Was this checked in recently?  Or long enough that we\u0027re going to break ancient clients.\n6. (you might have already done this, but just to document it) Does the webui use this functionality, and now needs fixed?\n\n\nYes, supporting PATCH on this is counter to the protocol, but it doesn\u0027t really effect our compatibility with well behaving clients.  If there\u0027s a specific validator/test we\u0027re trying to pass, that would significantly strengthen the argument for making this breaking change.",

      "message": "I\u0027m a little taken aback that this wasn\u0027t a rubber stamp Ed.\n1. Redfish API clearly indicates this is RO. The current use is a violation of that API.\n2. Per the Redfish spec HostName is RW from:\n/redfish/v1/Managers/bmc/EthernetInterfaces/eth(x)\n3. The Redfish API is clear, HostName is Read Only from this node. It\u0027s documented clearly. IMO no work needs to be done. OBMC breaks things all the time. An example is some recent sdbusplus changes that caused us some significant issues. The change was correct, our use was not. Functionality broke, and we had to figure out why. No one proactively sent out a message to all sdbusplus users saying \"I changed something that might break you.\".\n4. I disagree this is a mediocre reason. Why even have an agreed upon spec at all? This begins/continues a trend toward turning Redfish into multiple versions of IPMI, one for each IPMI vendor. The goal should be for any user of Redfish to read the schema and know what to expect. The goal should be for a computer to do the correct actions based on the schema. Permitting this to be RW breaks the \"rule\" of \"least surprise\". It is my opinion, when a dev finds a mismatch from the spec that a commit be made to follow the spec. OBMC isn\u0027t the only Redfish provider. What happens to a set of tests written to OBMC Redfish when they are applied to AMI Redfish? In theory they will all complete with the same results.\n5. Based on my statements in #4, I don\u0027t know that it much matters when the spec was violated. In any case, to answer your question, the commit that added this was done 1.75 years ago.\n6. I did not check webui. I am willing to bet it will need to be changed should this commit move forward.",
