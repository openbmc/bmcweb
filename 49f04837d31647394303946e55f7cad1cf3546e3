      "message": "From https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/57925 \n\n```\nEd Tanous\nWe need to get this feature more fleshed out, and get this turned on by default.\n\nCarson\nOff the top of my head these are the remaining features:\n\n1.    Aggregate all top level resource collections\n2.    Add links to satellite only collections in responses from service root and other appropriate locations\n3.    Generate aggregation prefix from uuid\n4.    Contains/ContainedBy relationship between local and aggregated Chassis resource\n5.    Aggregate more than one satellite\n6.    Add Authentication (login with satellites)\n7.    Support HTTPS connection to satellite.\n\nThere are already various levels of WIP patches for a number of those features. How many are needed to turn it on by default? My guess is the first 3, maybe #5 as well.\n\n Gunnar Mills \nI think 7 as well because otherwise you have to have a bmcweb with insecure options (we don\u0027t recommend insecure options for production) as the Satellite. Without that, it still feels like a non-production / wip option\n```\n\nI still think some of those are needed before this becomes enabled by default",

Aggregation is already optional at an entity-manager level;  Why do we need to maintain both avenues of optionality for people?\n\nAll of the above are great features to have, and I would like to see people add them, but I don\u0027t really think we need to gatekeep any longer now that the basics are in, and have been for several months.",

I agree this doesn\u0027t matter that much. One day this should be enabled by default and if today is the day, oh well. \n\nI still feel it isn\u0027t ready based on my thinking of to be enabled by default in bmcweb the meson option should be a production-ready, flushed-out feature and this isn\u0027t quite yet there. \n\nThe new powersubsystem/thermalsubsystem  https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/meson_options.txt#L201 isn\u0027t production-ready, flushed-out (the powersubsystem/thermalsubsystem is missing critical pieces like powersupply and fans). \n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/59940 is a new option for multi host, I wouldn\u0027t expect it to be enabled by default (or probably just go way in its case) until it supports multiple hosts across all existing endpoints (what I would consider production-ready, flushed-out)\n\nI feel this is still missing some important pieces like\n1.    Aggregate all top level resource collections\n2.    Add links to satellite only collections in responses from service root and other appropriate locations\n3.    Generate aggregation prefix from uuid\n\n\n5.    Aggregate more than one satellite\n\nYou convinced me that we don\u0027t need \"7. Support HTTPS connection to satellite.\" but I still feel getting some of the others in is needed for what I consider a production-ready, flushed-out feature. Maybe I\u0027m too strict on what should be enabled by default?\n\nCommits like https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/60905/ and above help get us there.\n\nAnd yeah, this is \"Also..... this is only defaults.\" so i\u0027m not upset if this goes today but would prefer another month and get a few more of those resolved like was discussed on https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/57925",

If it didn\u0027t conflict, I would enable it by default as well.\n\nBut that is how Redfish advised moving to the new powersubsystem/thermalsubsystem, they advised having both for some period. I still think the new powersubsystem/thermalsubsystem https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/master/meson_options.txt#L201 isn\u0027t production-ready, flushed-out so that is why shouldn\u0027t be enabled by it, not because we need a hard switch.\n\n\u003e With all the above said, a month seems totally reasonable in terms of a timeframe. One month it is.\n\nHaha. I came here to +1 this (and did). We are arguing about whether something should be the default now or in 1 or 2 months with some more development. If you wait 1 month, I am more happy but I am fine with this going today too. Note: I think this was all good discussion, we might in the future need more of a concrete what should be enabled by default ( I think we have slightly different views)",
