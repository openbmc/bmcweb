      "message": "I suspect there\u0027s a misunderstanding in how EM config interfaces work, and how this needs to be represented in a config.  It should be coming up with it\u0027s own type, given that an RDE device has a completely different set of properties than an http satellite device.\n\nWith that said, putting some things into a common structure is still valuable even without that, so if you make the changes below, this patch can merge.",
