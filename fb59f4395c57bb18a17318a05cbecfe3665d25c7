Ed responded that we prefer putting tests near where the sources under test are.\n\nThat\u0027s aligned with Google\u0027s convention. https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest/samples here are some examples.\n\nIt\u0027s not consistent in this project though. I don\u0027t have a strong opinion. Putting *_test files just next to sources is what I preferred.",
