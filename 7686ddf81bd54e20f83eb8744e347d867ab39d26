From the issue discussion[2] on the source code of the library, it implies that we need to add the DER format by ourselves (or by other library)\n\nI tried to double check on the client of this library on the GitHub[3] and every repo that I checked use external library to encode UTF-8. Some external libraries being used are pyasn1[4], asn1crypto[5], certipy[6].\n\nI used `asn1` library based on suggestion on this discussion[7]. Let me know if you have any further suggestions on this, thanks!\n\n[1] Documentation: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/  \n[2] Issue discussion: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6970#issuecomment-1070328889\n[3] GitHub search: https://github.com/search?q\u003dx509.OtherName+language%3APython\u0026type\u003dcode\u0026l\u003dPython\n[4] Example1 (pyasn1): https://github.com/zer1t0/certi/blob/6cfa656c6c0fcbbe9b9bce847b052c881202354e/certilib/certificate.py#L53\n[5] Example2 (asn1crypto): https://github.com/skelsec/aiosmb/blob/c8edd2163be2e423bee0c4db1c39eb519833e1be/aiosmb/examples/smbcertreq.py#L63-L71\n[6] Example3 (certipy): https://github.com/zblurx/certsync/blob/7c4efc5930201cdf13c13a7cbd4846331b405cf3/certsync/entry.py#L57-L58\n[7] `asn1` library discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73003466/how-to-create-a-csr-with-a-upn-san-using-python-cryptography-module",
