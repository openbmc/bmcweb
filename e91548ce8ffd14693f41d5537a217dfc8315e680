      "message": "There\u0027s some collections of these that we really shouldn\u0027t aggregate in a conventional sense.  TaskService for example, likely needs special handling to present a correct async task to clients.  TelemetryService is likely similar.  Account/Session service we shouldnt aggregate at all, because they\u0027re specific to the service root (ie, an aggregator user shouldn\u0027t be able to create a session on a sub ServiceRoot, only on the service root we\u0027re working with).\n\nThis is a great start;  Lets keep iterating on it.",

I wonder if we should be looking at that code as at least a model for this, or storing this as a trie?\n\nAlternatively, should we just have the policy that we have a BMCWEB_ROUTE for every top level collection, regardless of whether the bmc implements it?\n\nThis needs more thought for long-term consequences.",
