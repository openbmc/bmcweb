      "message": "This can\u0027t merge as designed.  We can\u0027t be imposing redfish rules in common layers.  There are interfaces in some of the other layers that use the DateTime key in their strings, so this isn\u0027t a hypothetical concern.\n\nIf you\u0027re on discord, it would be good to talk about options on where this could be put, and I support the usecase itself.\n\nFWIW, this is a \"should\" in the spec, so bmcweb is technically still in compliance.  Were you seeing real-world performance impacts on this?\n\nOne other potential solution that you could implement in your client is to use $select to only select the fields that you are using in your application, and omit DateTime.  That would get you an etag that didn\u0027t include datetime.  If you\u0027re chasing performance, $select is a good thing to do anyway.",
