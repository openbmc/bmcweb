      "message": "Even though code compiles with just passing `ec`, clangd marks this as an error. Mainly that static assertion failed and that std::formatter needs to be specialized for each type being formatted. It also complains about the statement not being a constant expression, considering std::basic_format_string is consteval. Funnily enough, just including \u0027app.hpp\u0027, satisfies clangd in terms of just passing `ec` rather than `ec.what()`. Considering that code compiles with just `ec`, should I revert this change?",
