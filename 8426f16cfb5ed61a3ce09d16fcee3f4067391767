      "message": "\u003e How does this play with webui-vue? \n\nI\u0027d be surprised if anything were broken.  The http 1.1 paths are still present and functional (given we\u0027re required to have them for Redfish compliance).\n\n\u003e webui-vue uses Axios which doesn\u0027t appear to have HTTP/2 support. \n\u003e \n\u003e https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1175\n\nNot sure what to do about that, but it looks like someone has a transport adapter to do http/2.  FWIW, I\u0027m not sure if we\u0027d see a significant improvement in webui performance with this, given everything is happening at human speed.  This patch is mainly targetting stuff that polls the bmc quite often during monitoring tasks.",
