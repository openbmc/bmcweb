Might as well just be setting the ok code when we know we\u0027re done.\n\nAs a note, the below would probably be better written inverted, so the \"good\" condition happened at the end of the method.\n\n\n    if (verifyCommonErrors(asyncResp-\u003eres, id, ec))\n    {\n        messages::internalError(asyncResp-\u003eres);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    asyncResp-\u003eres.result(boost::beast::http::status::no_content);\n    \n    \n    but up to you if you want to do that",
