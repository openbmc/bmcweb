Take a look at how the missing parameters are handled for how this would work.  To be more concrete\n\nreadJson(res, \"foo\", std::string, true);\nis non-nonsensical, because you\u0027re declaring a required parameter, but allowing empty.  At interface level, this shouldn\u0027t be allowed.\n\nAlso, for the template unpacking to work, you shouldn\u0027t add allowEmpty in the middle of the request.",
