      "message": "That\u0027s basically it.  Smaller binaries, smaller debug binaries, and fewer debugging of template parameters.  I also debated just making the number of digits a required field and doing away with the template entirely, which would\u0027ve simplified the code and reduced the binary size, but that seemed more invasive.",

      "message": "I would expect it to save about the same, given that I just moved a templated parameter to a runtime parameter, but the optimizer is likely going to optimize them down to the exact same code anyway.  If anything was different, it might be that the optimizer couldn\u0027t optimize the second argument, in which case the the more invasive change is \"worse\" by one int per call, but I really suspect they both generate identical code).",
