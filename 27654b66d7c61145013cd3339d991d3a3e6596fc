      "message": "That\u0027s basically it.  Smaller binaries, smaller debug binaries, and fewer debugging of template parameters.  I also debated just making the number of digits a required field and doing away with the template entirely, which would\u0027ve simplified the code and reduced the binary size, but that seemed more invasive.",
