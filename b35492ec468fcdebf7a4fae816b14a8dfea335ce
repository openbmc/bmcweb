You want to push the names of the webui into the name of the option here?  Or are you proposing we combine BMCWEB_ENABLE_LOGIN_PAGE with BMCWEB_INSECURE_UNAUTHENTICATED_JAVASCRIPT (or whatever we end up calling them) into one option?  That seems like it would remove the utility of anyone being able to replace the login page, not just in the webui-vue case.  I\u0027m not a huge fan of that, because it\u0027s not very descriptive, but I suspect I\u0027m not understanding what you\u0027re asking for.  I\u0027m assuming we\u0027d keep the _INSECURE_ part of the flag, right?\n\nIn the other commit, Brad suggested that we make webui-vue and phosphor-webui image options, and use those to set these flags appropriately, that way most people don\u0027t have to think about it, and as webui-vue evolves, it can revert the flags to default that it doesn\u0027t use.  I kinda like that idea from a \"options are descriptive of what they do\" standpoint.",

We are restricting that bundle to only the JavaScript needed to render the page and establish the translation functionality. In that case, I feel like this flag, BMCWEB_INSECURE_UNAUTHENTICATED_JAVASCRIPT, is not an accurate descriptor. I like Gunnar\u0027s suggestion of BMCWEB_Enable_JAVASCRIPT_LOGIN_PAGE. Possibly, something like BMCWEB_ENABLE_UNAUTHENTICATED_JAVASCRIPT_LOGIN_PAGE?\n\n\u003e In the other commit, Brad suggested that we make webui-vue and phosphor-webui image options\n\nI think this is an interesting option also.",
