      "message": "Yep.  This patchset is literally a find and replace of message_registry with registry, then a re-clang-format , and it does crazy things like this.\n\nAdmittedly, this code would ideally be broken down into some smaller functions before merge, but that\u0027s spilled milk under the bridge.\n\nclang-formats tabbing of lambdas seems to have some basis on how long the longest line is within the method, and is kind of subjective.  That\u0027s largely why I really want to move away from direct lambda callbacks, as it leads to crazy diffs like this on seemingly minor changes.",
