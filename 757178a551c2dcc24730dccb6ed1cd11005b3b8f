If we were to do something like this again, we would create a generic \"Register for session callbacks\" implementation within session service that IBM management console could register for, that way we can break up the dependencies in a way that doesn\u0027t require folks reading code to verify the IBM session service works properly, which they almost certainly don\u0027t have the test harnesses for.",
