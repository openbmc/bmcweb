      "message": "I\u0027d like to leave them following that pattern.  Once I get most repositories aligned to doing the right thing for some of these meson dependencies, I\u0027m going to add a linter that ensures we\u0027re doing them consistently.  Having a special variable for bmcweb (`bmcweb_dependencies +\u003d dependency....`) means the linter has to have a special case for your repository and I\u0027d like to avoid that as much as possible.",
