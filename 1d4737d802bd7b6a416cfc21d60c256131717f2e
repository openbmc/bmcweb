      "message": "Yeah the pool combined with queued requests and a retry policy makes it pretty ugly.  The same flow from before is there if you squint a bit.  I just replaced the handleConnState() calls with directly calling the next method in the chain and then the end behavior is handled the the callback.  \n\nUsing callbacks is ultimately what I came up with to handle having singular connection objects that are part of a pool with queued messages.  It also plays nice (I think) with future Redfish Aggregation plans where I will need to do additional processing on received responses.  Do you have some particular suggestions for spot it could be cleaned up?  I\u0027m game to try, but I don\u0027t see where to clean up the overall flow.",
