      "message": "Only downside of splitting commits up later is sometimes we lose comments. \n\nFrom https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/44564/9//COMMIT_MSG#18\n\nEd Tanous\nThis seems like it would have a race condition if the models are different.  Also, the redfish schema for this states:\n\n\"The processor model for the primary or majority of processors in this system.\"\nand\n\"This property shall contain the processor model for the central processors in the system, per the description in the Processor Information - Processor Family section of the SMBIOS Specification DSP0134 2.8 or later\"\n\nJonathan Doman\n\u003e \u003e Are we sure this model number matches up to the SMBIOS specification?\n\n\u003e Is it really up to bmcweb to enforce this? \nI thought if your data is wrong on D-Bus (e.g. an empty PartNumber) we just put it out on Redfish.\n\nI think the point is this commit changes Model to pull from Inventory.Decorator.Asset.Model instead of Inventory.Item.Cpu.Family as it was doing before. On Intel systems using smbios-mdr to provide this data on D-Bus, ony the latter is a model string which matches up to the options in the SMBIOS spec. As Ed quoted, I think Redfish spec implies the current behavior is more correct.",

      "message": "FWIW, I have an open issue with DMTF about something related to this.  There seems to be the EffectiveFamily property for the hex version of this, but no Family property that this would normally be loaded in.\n\nPart of me wonders if that\u0027s a typo, or was on purpose.  Mapping the property called \"model\" to family, when there\u0027s a separate EffectiveFamily property, and a differently defined \"Model\" property on the processor itself, seems really odd.  As a user, I would\u0027ve expected ProcessorSummary.Model for a given system to match Processor.Model for the processors in the system, but the way the descriptions read, that\u0027s not the case.  On the simple-rack-mounted-server mockup, Processor.Model puts the string version of the table 22 processor family in the Processor.Model resource, which I don\u0027t think is what we did on OpenBMC initially.  Maybe that\u0027s some of the issue?",
