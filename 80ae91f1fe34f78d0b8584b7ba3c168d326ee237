This was not changed as part of the commit which removed the Context for the get path. https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/c9bd09240cfa156ca348848ad6402b1d390bbfa1/redfish-core/lib/event_service.hpp#L490\n\n(For non-SNMPv2c subscriptions the UserSubscription is created here https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/c9bd09240cfa156ca348848ad6402b1d390bbfa1/redfish-core/lib/event_service.hpp#L495, and inserted here https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/blob/c9bd09240cfa156ca348848ad6402b1d390bbfa1/redfish-core/lib/event_service.hpp#L730)\n\nBut as I noted in the commit message the delete path still tries to delete the UserSubscription. So for consistency between get and delete paths I added back the lookup for the matching UserSubscription.",
