      "message": "The hardcoded size and dot notation to know the meaning of the various MessageEntry fields were what we lost when we had to resolve build warnings before C++20.\n\nRemoving the hardcoded size helps simplify adding new messages to the registry and is a smaller change.\n\nAdding back the dot notation is a bigger change but may not have much benefit anymore.  I am happy to pursue that change as well if there is interest.  Thanks!",
