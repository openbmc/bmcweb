      "message": "Redfish does not provide a good way for creating/deleting VLAN after \"VLANs\" property is deprecated after 1.7.0, we still need that property, so it cannot be bumped to newer versions.\n\nBelow is a previous discussion at https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/bmcweb/+/52951\n\n\u003e A limitation is that latest schema does not provide a proper way to create VLANs. I had a discussion in redfish from at https://redfishforum.com/thread/619/proper-create-using-ethernetinterface-schema\n\u003e \n\u003e My proposal is to keep using the deprecated VLanNetworkInterface for creating/deleting VLANs, while also exposes the VLAN interfaces under /â€‹redfish/â€‹v1/â€‹Managers/â€‹bmc/â€‹EthernetInterfaces/â€‹ for configuring them. This workaround will be here until redfish spec reached a solution, after that, remove the VLANs property. This patchset is the first stage of moving to the new way.",
