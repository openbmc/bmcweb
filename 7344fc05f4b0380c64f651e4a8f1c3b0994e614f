      "message": "I feel like there ought to be a way to write a change intended as a patch, but viewable through gerrit using the normal diff tool. Because right now the downstream patch is pretty difficult to read, but this PR just adds noise upstream.\n\nHonestly this is probably an argument to have a downstream mirror.",
