      "message": "There are two methods of \"rearming\" the intrusion sensor: Automatic and Manual. In Auto mode, the sensor is showing the intrusion state real time, which means that closing the chassis cover after an intrusion event will restore the sensor state. However, in Manual mode, it expects a manual rearm \"to the sensor\" to restore its normal state, which means after an intrusion event, the IntrusionSensor will remain HardwareIntrusion (even when we re-attach the cover) until a rearm action is done for it to be restored back to Normal.\n\nIn https://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/Chassis.v1_24_0.json, longDescription of property IntrusionSensor under Chassis/PhysicalSecurity says: \"This property shall contain the physical security state of the chassis.  If the IntrusionSensorReArm property contains `Manual`, a client may set this property to `Normal` to reset the physical security state\". So this is kind of a rearm by software to the sensor.\n\nTherefore, when I added the Rearm property to chassis intrusion sensor interface in dbus-sensors (https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/58205), we expect the rearm action to be executed via Redfish (by patching Normal to Chassis/chassis/PhysicalSecurity/Intrusionsensor, it writes Normal to the Status property on DBus and restores the sensor).",
