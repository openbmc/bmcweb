Arguably a handler could want to return 200 from a websocket route instead of upgrading, so if we\u0027re going to allow the concept of \"the bmc route rejected the upgrade\" we\u0027ll need some other flag.",

      "message": "As mentioned in the comment below, the default response of http::response is 200. \nThe reason this explicit check is done is because, if everything was smooth and upgradation was done, the response would contain 200, so since the upgradation is already done, we wouldn\u0027t need to reply through this connection. That\u0027s why calling the else section to destroy this connection.\nIncase of any errors, say like privilege check error, we would need to reply through the same connection without upgrading.\nSo, only unsuccessful messages needs to be communicated through this channel.\n\nEither ways, on success i.e. on upgrade, we wouldn\u0027t have this adaptor anymore to send the OK response.",
