If a user should not have access then the user itself should be disabled, and that pam check should fail.\n\nIdeally we shouldn\u0027t be using dbus at all for role generation (we previously used only PAM) but a lot of code got stuck in as part of the LDAP work that complicated the design.\n\nIn a perfect world, if we\u0027re going to authenticate/authorize over dbus, we should ONLY be using dbus.  If we\u0027re using pam, we should ONLY be using pam.  We shouldn\u0027t do the pam/dbus hybrid we have now, that\u0027s what leads to bugs like this.",

Specifically the proposed design is: if authentication succeeds, then BMCWeb knows the user\u0027s role and can retrieve the user\u0027s Redfish privileges, and check if the user has the \"Login\" privilege.

IMHO, we should get that answer before proceeding with a fix.  Otherwise:\n1. What is the point of having a disabled account?  What is it used for?\n2. For an enabled account which has the no-access role, I believe BMCWeb should handle it in the same way as any other role.  Specifically, after a successful authentication, I believe PAM account management checks should succeed, and the user\u0027s privileges should be retrieved.  In this case the privileges will be the empty set.  The login operations should then fail.  \u003c-- That is what I proposed in my comment above.  Specifically, the login operation(s) should ensure the user trying to login has the Redfish Login privilege.",

See the meta-phosphor layer for more details on them.  With that said, this file only gets invoked for pam_authenticate, not for checking the health of the user account that I posted earlier in this thread.\n\n\u003e Are you proposing that we should introduce a new pam module and all the callers pam configuration file will add that module in their configuration so during pam_authentication check it will fail for those users which have the no access role.\n\nNo, I\u0027m proposing that users that are given a \"NoAccess\" role should be disabled, such that the pam health check that I linked above fails.  This should just require phosphor-user-manager to properly adjust the users enabled-ness.",

There is an enterprise case for disabling someones access temporarily, given that user passwords are hashed on the device, you generally can\u0027t destroy and create a user losslessly, so instead there\u0027s a way to disable a given user for a period of time without destroying their credentials.\n\n\u003e If somebody is creating a user with no privilege and user manager makes that user disable that doesn\u0027t make sense(it is of no use), Instead of we should not allow that user to be created.\n\nThat would be fine too if we just want to disallow NoAccess users from existing.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e But seems we need to understand from the IPMI perspective too, why do we need such user?\n\n+1",
