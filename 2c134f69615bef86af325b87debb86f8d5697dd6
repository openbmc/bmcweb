If a user should not have access then the user itself should be disabled, and that pam check should fail.\n\nIdeally we shouldn\u0027t be using dbus at all for role generation (we previously used only PAM) but a lot of code got stuck in as part of the LDAP work that complicated the design.\n\nIn a perfect world, if we\u0027re going to authenticate/authorize over dbus, we should ONLY be using dbus.  If we\u0027re using pam, we should ONLY be using pam.  We shouldn\u0027t do the pam/dbus hybrid we have now, that\u0027s what leads to bugs like this.",

Specifically the proposed design is: if authentication succeeds, then BMCWeb knows the user\u0027s role and can retrieve the user\u0027s Redfish privileges, and check if the user has the \"Login\" privilege.

IMHO, we should get that answer before proceeding with a fix.  Otherwise:\n1. What is the point of having a disabled account?  What is it used for?\n2. For an enabled account which has the no-access role, I believe BMCWeb should handle it in the same way as any other role.  Specifically, after a successful authentication, I believe PAM account management checks should succeed, and the user\u0027s privileges should be retrieved.  In this case the privileges will be the empty set.  The login operations should then fail.  \u003c-- That is what I proposed in my comment above.  Specifically, the login operation(s) should ensure the user trying to login has the Redfish Login privilege.",

As mentioned in the previous discussions, the authentication is with pam library and authorization is with the user-manager app(dbus)\n\nThe #1 solution needs an agreement with the phosphor-user-manager maintainers and a bit more re-design of the authorization checks. This needs more analysis and time. I am not an expert in that areas. Thus i would like to go ahead with this #2, until we have that #1 concluded. We already have this similar check at routing.hpp - so its not a new thing at bmcweb.\n\nI think this commit and the routing.hpp can be re-visited together when the user-manager has the required changes to disable the no-access user and link the pam module to the same.",
