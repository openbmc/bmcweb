What we originally did technically violates Redfish, but is part of a \"test\" mode, so (at the time) it was deemed that standard compliance wasn\u0027t that important, as there\u0027s no expectation that it would get used in a \"real\" deployment.  I\u0027m struggling a little because, yes, it\u0027s incorrect, but it really is just a minor extension of something we already checked in and approved.\n\nI need to give this more thought.  It would help this patchset a ton if someone would open up a review in the DMTF github to discuss this.",
