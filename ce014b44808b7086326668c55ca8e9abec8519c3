      "message": "\u003e That would generally be incorrect in Redfish\n\nCan you kindly help me to understand this one? Had a look into the redfish data model spec and found this one:\n\n\u003e The LogService schema contains properties for monitoring and configuring a log service. When the Id property\ncontains DeviceLog , the log contains device-resident log entries that follow the physical device when moved from\nsystem-to-system, and not a replication or subset of a system event log\n\nWhen looking at a response from bmcweb, the ```Id``` property is ```EventLog``` so i assume that it is fine for the response to be a replication of a system event log?\n\nIf there is currently no way to filter event log entries for the host they belong to, what is the more useful behavior? Having no logs or a duplicate?",
