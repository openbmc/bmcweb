Responses are JSON\nB. Responses follow Redfish OEM semantics\n\nSo putting two assumptions at this level isn\u0027t really appropriate (and other subsystems like dbus might invent their own sub fragment handlers).\n\nMove this to RedfishService please, and call from SetupRedfishRouteWithDelegation",

The only change you see in routing.hpp is enhancement to class Trie to be able to manage and treat fragments. The oem routes re-uses the Ties class and maintains its own static model. All APIs of OEM router are already moved to RedfishService Class.",
