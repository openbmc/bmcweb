      "message": "Cool to see progress, and happy to help you work through getting it merged.\n\nSome initial thoughts that come to mind:\n1. Presumably this library is doing blocking filesystem calls, which could lock up all of bmcweb (given that it\u0027s a single-threaded reactor).  Do we need to evict this audit logging to another process where it can be done at a lower priority soas not to impact the performance?\n2. This patch is proposing auditd be a required dependency.  Surely there are users that would opt out of it?  If so, how do we manage that complexity?  Runtime selection?  Compile time?\n3. Overall, my eventual goal was to completely remove session collections out of bmcweb, and make use of one of the existing login daemons (probably systemd logind) through pam.  This would get us more standard login/logout procedures, and we could easily hook in whatever plugins we wanted, including this one, because users would be logging in \"normally\".  This is similar to what the cockpit project (another webserver for remote managing linux systems) does.  If that were to happen, would that make using this plugin easier?",
