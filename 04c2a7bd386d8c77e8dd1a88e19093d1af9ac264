      "message": "I see some holes in the design, but I believe they are not worth fixing.\n\n1. Note the cookie is created only for logins with looksLikePhosphorRest-style data: {\"data\":[\"someuser\":\"thepassword\"].  But during logout, the cookie is re-created as an expired cookie - regardless of if the cookie was created in the first place.  For example, if you login with a non-looksLikePhosphorRest-style data, you will not get a cookie at login, but an expired cookie will appear when you log out.\n\n2. If you login with looksLikePhosphorRest-style data, and log out via the Redfish session service (DELETE /redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/\u003csessionid\u003e), then your cookie will not be expired at logout.  But of course the Web GUI app does not use the session service to log out.\n\nOverall, this patch seems a bit sketchy, but if its purpose it to help ensure the Web App\u0027s session cookies are deleted during logout, then I approve.",
