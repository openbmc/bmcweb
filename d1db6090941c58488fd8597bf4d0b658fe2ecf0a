      "message": "And one issue we\u0027re discovering with this is that\u0027s it\u0027s a \"From\" firmware level type issue. i.e. you could be fine when you first ship a system with the smaller timeout, but if the image grows past a certain size in your next release, you now have no way to fix this issue without doing some intermediate firmware release that bumps the timeout. So best to have a large timeout that covers all possible growth in the future.\n\nFor us, we package the host firmware in our image, and that\u0027s where all of the growth occurred.",

      "message": "I\u0027m on the fence here for a couple reasons:\n1. Anything that\u0027s expected to take over 10 seconds should be using TaskService, so that users don\u0027t think their system has locked up, or hit the limits on their browser/curl/whatever\n2. Once that\u0027s done, should we just be upping this timer to something VERY large, like a minute?  If we hit it, we\u0027re in a failure mode anyway, so the actual timeout likely doesn\u0027t really matter.\n\nWere either of these considered?",
