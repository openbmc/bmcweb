      "message": "And one issue we\u0027re discovering with this is that\u0027s it\u0027s a \"From\" firmware level type issue. i.e. you could be fine when you first ship a system with the smaller timeout, but if the image grows past a certain size in your next release, you now have no way to fix this issue without doing some intermediate firmware release that bumps the timeout. So best to have a large timeout that covers all possible growth in the future.\n\nFor us, we package the host firmware in our image, and that\u0027s where all of the growth occurred.",
